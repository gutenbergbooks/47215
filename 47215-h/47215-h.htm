<h2 class="eee">PREFACE</h2>
<p>The reader is requested to bear in mind that this
volume lays no claim to scholarship, independent
research, or originality of view. Its aim has been
to select and collate, from sources not always easily
accessible to the general reader, certain facts and
conclusions bearing upon a subject of acknowledged
interest. In so dealing with one of the many modes
of primitive religion, it is perhaps inevitable that
the writer should seem to exaggerate its importance,
and in isolating a given series of data to undervalue
the significance of the parallel facts from which they
are severed. It is undeniable that the worship of
the spirit-inhabited tree has usually, if not always,
been linked with, and in many cases overshadowed
by other cults; that sun, moon, and stars, sacred
springs and stones, holy mountains, and animals of
the most diverse kind, have all been approached
with singular impartiality by primitive man, as enshrining
or symbolising a divine principle. But no
other form of pagan ritual has been so widely distributed,
has left behind it such persistent traces,
or appeals so closely to modern sympathies as the
worship of the tree; of none is the study better
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
calculated to throw light on the dark ways of primitive
thought, or to arouse general interest in a branch of
research which is as vigorous and fruitful as it is new.
For these reasons, in spite of obvious disadvantages,
its separate treatment has seemed to the writer to be
completely justifiable.</p>

<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">TREE-WORSHIP&mdash;ITS DISTRIBUTION AND ORIGIN</span></h2>
<p>It is the purpose of the present volume to deal as
concisely as possible with the many religious observances,
popular customs, legends, traditions and ideas
which have sprung from or are related to the primitive
conception of the tree-spirit. There is little doubt
that most if not all races, at some period of their
development, have regarded the tree as the home,
haunt, or embodiment of a spiritual essence, capable
of more or less independent life and activity, and able
to detach itself from its material habitat and to appear
in human or in animal form. This belief has left
innumerable traces in ancient art and literature, has
largely shaped the usages and legends of the peasantry,
and impressed its influence on the ritual of almost all
the primitive religions of mankind. There is, indeed,
scarcely a country in the world where the tree has not
at one time or another been approached with reverence
or with fear, as being closely connected with some
spiritual potency.</p>
<p>The evidence upon which this assertion is based
is overwhelming in amount, and is frequently to be
found in quarters where until lately its presence was
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
unsuspected or its significance ignored. For instance,
in the interior of that fascinating storehouse of
antiquity, St. Mark&rsquo;s at Venice, there are embedded
in the walls, high above one&rsquo;s head, a number of
ancient sculptured slabs, on each of which a conventionalised
plant, with foliage most truthfully and
lovingly rendered, is set between two fabulous
monsters, as fantastic and impossible as any supporters
to be met with in the whole range of heraldry (see
<a href="#fig1">Frontispiece</a>). To the ordinary observer these strange
sculptures say nothing; probably he passes over them
lightly, as the offspring of that quaint mediaeval fancy
which was so prolific in monstrous births. But the
student of Oriental art at once detects in them a
familiar design, a design whose pedigree can be traced
back to the day, six thousand years ago, when the
Chaldaean Semites were taking their culture and
religion from the old Accadians who dwelt on the
shores of the Persian Gulf. In the central plant he
recognises the symbol or ideograph of a divine
attribute or activity, if not a representation of the
visible embodiment or abode of a god, and in the
raised hand or forepaw of the supporters he discerns
the conventional attitude of adoration. The design,
in short, which was probably handed on from Assyria
to Persia, and from Persia to Byzantium, and so to
Venice, is a vestige of that old world religion which
regarded the tree as one of the sacred haunts of deity.</p>
<p>Again, the same conception, the record of which
is thus strangely preserved in the very fabric of a
Christian edifice, is to be traced with equal certainty
in the older and scarcely less permanent fabric of
popular tradition and custom. The folk-lore of the
modern European peasant, and the observances with
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
which Christmas, May-day, and the gathering of the
harvest are still celebrated in civilised countries, are
all permeated by the primitive idea that there was a
spiritual essence embodied in vegetation, that trees,
like men, had spirits, passing in and out amongst them,
which possessed a mysterious and potent influence
over human affairs, and which it was therefore wise
and necessary to propitiate.</p>
<p>A third example of the less recondite evidence on
the subject is to be found in the Book that we all know
best. When we once realise how deeply rooted and
time-honoured was the belief that there was a spiritual
force inherent in vegetation, we cease to wonder at
the perversity with which the less cultured Israelites
persisted in planting groves and setting up altars under
every green tree. Read in the light of modern research,
the Old Testament presents a drama of surpassing
interest, a record of internecine struggle
between the aspiration of the few towards the worship
of a single, omnipresent, unconditioned God and the
conservative adhesion of the many to the primitive
ritual and belief common to all the Semitic tribes.
For the backsliding children of Israel were no more
idolaters, in the usual meaning of the word, than were
the Canaanites whose rites they imitated. Their
view of nature was that of the primitive Semite, if
not of the primitive man. All parts of nature, in
their idea, were full of spiritual forces, more or less,
but never completely, detached in their movements
and action from the material objects to which they
were supposed properly to belong. &ldquo;In ritual the
sacred object was spoken of and treated as the god
himself; it was not merely his symbol, but his
embodiment, the permanent centre of his activity, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
the same sense in which the human body is the
permanent centre of man&rsquo;s activity. The god inhabited
the tree or sacred stone not in the sense in
which a man inhabits a house, but in the sense in
which his soul inhabits his body.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>To the three classes of evidence, derived respectively
from archaeology, from folk-lore, and from
ancient literature, which have been thus briefly exemplified,
may be added a fourth, equally important
and prolific, that namely of contemporary anthropology.
Scarcely a book is printed on the customs of uncivilised
races which does not contribute some new
fact to the subject. The illustration of an Arab
praying to a tree, in Slatin Pasha&rsquo;s recently published
volume, is no surprise to the anthropologist, who has
learnt to look for such survivals of primitive customs
wherever culture still remains primitive.</p>

</div>
<p>Now of all primitive customs and beliefs there is
none which has a greater claim upon our interest than
the worship of the tree, for there is none which has
had a wider distribution throughout the world, or has
left a deeper impress on the traditions and observances
of mankind. Its antiquity is undoubted, for when
history begins to speak, we find it already firmly
established amongst the oldest civilised races. What is
probably its earliest record is met with on the engraved
cylinders of Chaldaea, some of which date back to
4000 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Even at that period it would appear that
the Chaldaeans had advanced beyond the stage of
crude tree-worship, as found to this day amongst
uncivilised races, for the sacred tree had already
undergone a process of idealisation. In a bilingual
hymn, which is of Accadian origin, and probably one of
the most ancient specimens of literature in existence,
a mystical tree is described as the abode of the gods.
And it was probably by a similar process of idealisation
that a conventional representation of the sacred
tree came to be one of the most important symbols of
Chaldaean religion. This symbol, which we have
already seen in decorative use on the slabs at St.
Mark&rsquo;s, appears on the oldest Chaldaean cylinders
&ldquo;as a stem divided at the base, surmounted by a fork
or a crescent, and cut, midway, by one or more cross
bars which sometimes bear a fruit at each extremity.
This rudimentary image frequently changes into the
palm, the pomegranate, the cypress, vine, etc.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> On the
Assyrian monuments of about 1000 <span class="small">B.C.</span> and later, the
figure becomes still more complex and more artistically
conventionalised, and it nearly always stands between
two personages facing each other, who are sometimes
priests or kings in an attitude of adoration, sometimes
monstrous creatures, such as are so often met with in
Assyro-Chaldaean imagery, lions, sphinxes, griffins,
unicorns, winged bulls, men or <i>genii</i> with the head of
an eagle, and so forth. Above it is frequently suspended
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
the winged circle, personifying the supreme
deity.&rdquo; In his exhaustive chapter on this ancient
design, M. Goblet d&rsquo;Alviella has shown that it obtained
a wide dissemination throughout the world, and is
used even to this day in the fictile and textile art of
the East.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> M. Menant concludes from his exhaustive
study of the cylinders, that the worship of the sacred
tree in Assyria was intimately associated with that
of the supreme deity, its symbol being incontestably
one of the most sacred emblems of the Assyrian
religion.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> M. Lenormant&rsquo;s view was that the winged
circle, in conjunction with the sacred tree, represented
the primeval cosmogonic pair, the creative sun and the
fertile earth, and was a symbol of the divine mystery
of generation.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> In Babylonia the sacred tree was no
doubt closely associated with Istar, the divine mother,
who was originally not a Semitic, but an Accadian
goddess, and whose cult, together with that of her
bridegroom Tammuz, was introduced into Chaldaea
from Eridu, a city which flourished on the shores of
the Persian Gulf between 3000 and 4000 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> That
the Accadians were familiar with the worship of the
tree may also be inferred from the fact that their chief
god, Ea, was closely associated with the sacred cedar,
on whose core his name was supposed to be inscribed.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">

</div>
<p>But however much their attitude towards the
sacred tree may have been modified under Accadian
influence, the Chaldaeans in their worship of the tree
only followed the rule of their Semitic kindred, for
&ldquo;the conception of trees as demoniac beings was
familiar to all the Semites, and the tree was adored as
divine in every part of the Semitic area.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> Even
that stationary Semite, the modern Arab, holds certain
trees inviolable as being inhabited by spirits, and
honours them with sacrifices and decorations, and to
this day the traveller in Palestine sometimes lights
upon holy trees hung with tokens of homage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>This strange persistence of a primitive religion in
the very birthplace of a most exalted spiritual worship is
an additional evidence of its remarkable vitality. For
there is no country in the world where the tree was
ever more ardently worshipped than it was in ancient
Palestine. Amongst the Canaanites every altar to
the god had its sacred tree beside it, and when the
Israelites established local sanctuaries under their
influence, they set up their altar under a green tree,
and planted beside it as its indispensable accompaniment
an <i>ash&ecirc;ra</i>, which was either a living tree or a
tree-like post, and not a &ldquo;grove,&rdquo; as rendered in the
Authorised Version. This <i>ash&ecirc;ra</i> was undoubtedly
worshipped as a sacred symbol of the deity. Originally
it appears to have been associated with Ashtoreth
or Astarte, the Syrian Istar, the revolting character of
whose worship perhaps explains the excessive bitterness
of the biblical denunciations.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> But the <i>ash&ecirc;ra</i>
was also erected by the altars of other gods, and in
pre-prophetic days even beside that of Jehovah Himself,
whence it may be concluded that &ldquo;in early times
tree-worship had such a vogue in Canaan, that the
sacred tree or the pole, its surrogate, had come to be
viewed as a <i>general</i> symbol of deity.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> The great
antiquity of the cult in Syria was recognised in the
local traditions, for an old Phoenician cosmogony,
quoted by Eusebius, states that &ldquo;the first men consecrated
the plants shooting out of the earth, and judged
them gods, and worshipped them, and made meat and
drink offerings to them.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> In addition to the <i>ash&ecirc;ra</i>,
the Chaldaean symbol of the sacred tree between its
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
supporters was also familiar to the Phoenicians, and is
found wherever their art penetrated, notably in Cyprus
and on the archaic pottery of Corinth and Athens.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> It
is highly probable that both these sacred symbols had
a common origin, but the connection must have been
lost sight of in later times, for we find Ezekiel, to
whom the prophetic denunciations of the <i>ash&ecirc;ra</i> must
have been familiar, decorating the temple of his vision
with designs evidently derived from the Chaldaean
sacred tree, &ldquo;a palm-tree between a cherub and a
cherub.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> A similar ornamentation with palm-trees
and cherubim, it will be remembered, had been used
in the temple built by Solomon.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Amongst the ancient Egyptians, whose &ldquo;exuberant
piety&rdquo; required, according to M. Maspero, &ldquo;an actual
rabble of gods&rdquo; to satisfy it, trees were enthusiastically
worshipped, side by side with other objects, as the
homes of various divinities. The splendid green sycamores,
which flourish here and there as though by
miracle on the edge of the cultivated land, their rootlets
bathed by the leakage of the Nile, were accounted
divine and earnestly worshipped by Egyptians of
every rank, in the belief that they were animated by
spirits, who on occasion could emerge from them.
They were habitually honoured with fruit offerings,
and the charitable found an outlet for their benevolence
in daily replenishing the water-jars placed beneath
them for the use of the passer-by, who in his turn
would express his gratitude for the boon by reciting a
prayer to the deity of the tree. The most famous of
these sycamores&mdash;the sycamore of the South&mdash;was
regarded as the living body of H&#257;thor upon earth;
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
and the tree at Metairieh, commonly called the Tree
of the Virgin, is probably the successor of a sacred
tree of Heliopolis, in which a goddess, perhaps H&#257;thor,
was worshipped.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> The district around Memphis was
known as the Land of the Sycamore, and contained
several trees generally believed to be inhabited by
detached doubles of Nu&#788;&icirc;t and H&#257;thor. Similar trees
are worshipped at the present day both by Christian
and Mussulman fellah&icirc;n.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of the province of Darfur the
Bedeyat Arabs, though surrounded by Moslem tribes,
still adhere to the same primitive cult. Under the
wide-spreading branches of an enormous heglik-tree,
and on a spot kept beautifully clean and sprinkled
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
with fine sand, they beseech an unknown god to direct
them in their undertakings and to protect them from
danger.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> They have, in short, retained, in spite of the
pressure of Islamism, the old heathen worship which
still widely prevails amongst the uncivilised races of
the African continent. Thus on the Guinea Coast
almost every village has its sacred tree, and in some
parts offerings are still made to them. The negroes
of the Congo plant a sacred tree before their houses
and set jars of palm-wine under it for the tree-spirit.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a>
In Dahomey prayers and gifts are offered to trees in
time of sickness. One of the goddesses of the Fantis
has her abode in huge cotton-trees. In the Nyassa
country, where the spirits of the dead are worshipped
as gods, the ceremonies are conducted and offerings
placed not at the grave of the dead man, but at the
foot of the tree which grows before his house, or if
that be unsuitable, beneath some especially beautiful
tree selected for the purpose.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>To return to ancient Egypt, there is evidence that
the great Osiris was originally a tree-god. According
to Egyptian mythology, after he had been murdered
his coffin was discovered enclosed in a tree-trunk, and
he is spoken of in the inscriptions as &ldquo;the one in the
tree,&rdquo; &ldquo;the solitary one in the acacia.&rdquo; The rites, too,
by which his death and burial were annually celebrated
appear to couple him closely with Tammuz, Adonis,
Attis, Dionysus, and other gods whose worship was
associated with a similar ritual.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> Mr. Frazer, following
Mannhardt, contends that all these deities were tree-gods,
and that the ceremonial connected with their
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
worship was symbolical of the annual death and revival
of vegetation. It is certainly true that in Babylonia,
Egypt, Phoenicia, and above all in Phrygia, a peculiarly
emotional form of worship, which subsequently
extended to Cyprus, Crete, Greece, and Italy, arose in
connection with deities who were closely associated
with vegetable life. Tammuz&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured</p>
<p class="t0">The Syrian damsels to lament his fate,</p>
</div>
<p>and for whose resuscitation his bride, the goddess
Istar, descended into Hades&mdash;was represented as
originally dwelling in a tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> Adonis, who was the
beloved of Aphrodite&mdash;the Syrian Astarte&mdash;and is
Tammuz under another name, was born from a myrrh-tree.
Attis, the favourite of Cybele, who was worshipped
with barbarous rites in Phrygia, was represented
in the form of a decorated pine-tree, to which
his image was attached. Dionysus, whose death and
resurrection were celebrated in Crete and elsewhere,
was worshipped throughout Greece as &ldquo;Dionysus of
the Tree.&rdquo; These facts are sufficient to warrant the
inference that tree-worship was very firmly rooted in
those regions where the Semitic races came into
contact with the Aryans. In Phrygia it was peculiarly
prominent, as we know from classical references. The
archaeological evidence is vague and incomplete, but a
characteristic device frequent in Phrygian art, in which
two animals, usually lions rampant, face one another
on either side of a pillar, or an archaic representation
of the mother-goddess Cybele,<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> recalls the sacred tree
of Babylonia. The device is familiar in connection
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
with the lion-gate of Mycenae, which was probably
erected under Phrygian influence.</p>
<p>The Persians venerated trees as the dwelling-place
of the deity, as the haunts of good and evil spirits,
and as the habitations in which the souls of heroes
and of the virtuous dead continued their existence.
According to Plutarch, they assigned some trees and
plants to the good God, others to the evil demon.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a>
The Zend-Avesta ordained that the trees which
Ormuzd had given should be prayed to as pure and
holy, and adored with fire and lustral water;<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> and
according to tradition, when Zoroaster died, Ormuzd
himself translated his soul into a lofty tree, and
planted it upon a high mountain. The cypress was
regarded by the Persians as especially sacred. It was
closely associated with fire-worship, and was revered
as a symbol of the pure light of Ormuzd. It is frequently
represented on ancient gravestones in conjunction
with the lion, the symbol of the sun-god
Mithra.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> Another venerated tree was the myrtle, a
branch of which was used as an essential accompaniment
in all religious functions. The observances connected
with the Persian worship of the Haoma plant
will be dealt with in a later chapter. The Achaemenian
kings regarded the plane as their peculiar tree, and a
representation of it in gold formed part of their state.
A certain plane-tree in Lydia was presented by Xerxes
with vessels of gold and costly apparel, and committed
to the guardianship of one of his &ldquo;immortals.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></p>
<p>In India, where tree-worship once enjoyed a wide
prevalence, it has left indubitable traces on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
religions which displaced it, and it is still encountered
in its crudest form amongst some of the aboriginal
hill tribes. The Garrows, for instance, who possess
neither temples nor altars, set up a bamboo before
their huts, and sacrifice before it to their deity.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> On
a mountain in Travancore there existed until quite
recently an ancient tree, which was regarded by the
natives as the residence of a powerful deity. Sacrifices
were offered to it, and sermons preached before
it; it served, indeed, as the cathedral of the district.
At length, to the horror of its worshippers, an English
missionary had it cut down and used in the construction
of a chapel on its site.<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> The ancient prevalence of
tree-worship in India is established by frequent
references to sacred trees in the Vedas, and by the
statement of Q. Curtius that the companions of Alexander
the Great noticed that the Indians &ldquo;reputed as
gods whatever they held in reverence, especially trees,
which it was death to injure.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> This ancient reverence
for the tree was recognised by Buddhism, and
adapted to its more advanced mode of thought. The
asvattha or pippala-tree, <i>Ficus Religiosa</i>, which had
previously been identified with the supreme deity,
Brahma, came to be venerated above all others by the
special injunction of Gautama, as that under which he
had achieved perfect knowledge.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> In his previous
incarnations Gautama himself is represented as having
been a tree-spirit no less than forty-three times. The
evidence of the monuments as to the importance
attached to the tree in early Buddhism is equally
definite. The S&acirc;nchi and Ama-ravati sculptures, some
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
casts of which are in the British Museum, contain
representations of the sacred tree decorated with
garlands and surrounded by votaries, whilst the worship
of the trees identified with the various Buddhas
is repeatedly represented on the St&ucirc;pa of Bharhut.</p>

</div>
<p>There is very little evidence of the existence of
tree-worship amongst the Chinese, but they have a
tradition of a Tree of Life, and of a drink of immortality
made from various sacred plants. They
also make use of the divining-rod, which is an offshoot
of tree-worship, and certain Taoist medals, like the
talismans worn in Java, bear the familiar symbol of
the sacred tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> In Japan certain old trees growing
near Shinto temples are regarded as sacred, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
bound with a fillet of straw rope, &ldquo;as if they were
tenanted by a divine spirit.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> Japanese mythology
tells of holy <i>sakaki</i> trees growing on the Mountain of
Heaven, and of a herb of immortality to be gathered
on the Island of Eternal Youth.</p>
<p>Amongst the semi-civilised races which border
upon these ancient states the tree is still almost
universally regarded as the dwelling-place of a spirit,
and as such is protected, venerated, and often presented
with offerings. In Sumatra and Borneo certain
old trees are held to be sacred, and the Dyaks would
regard their destruction as an impious act. The
Mintira of the Malay Peninsula believe that trees are
inhabited by terrible spirits capable of inflicting
diseases. The Talein of Burmah never cut down a
tree without a prayer to the indwelling spirit. The
Siamese have such veneration for the takhien-tree that
they offer it cakes and rice before felling it; so strong,
indeed, is their dread of destroying trees of any kind,
and thereby offending the gods inhabiting them, that
all necessary tree-felling is relegated to the lowest
criminals. Even at the present day they frequently
make offerings to the tree-dwelling spirits, and hang
gifts on any tree whose deity they desire to propitiate.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></p>
<p>In the Western Hemisphere, the fact that the
drawing of a tree with two opposed personages or
supporters, similar in design to the sacred tree of the
Chaldaeans, has been found in an ancient Mexican
MS., has been put forward as an additional argument
in favour of the pre-Columbian colonisation of that
continent and its early contact with the Eastern world.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
Speaking generally, however, the worship of the tree
appears to have flourished less widely in the New
World than the Old, though traces of it have been
found all over the continent.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> A large ash-tree is
regarded with great veneration by the Indians of Lake
Superior, and in Mexico there was a cypress, the
spreading branches of which were loaded by the
natives with votive offerings,
locks of hair, teeth,
and morsels of ribbon; it
was many centuries old,
and had probably had
mysterious influence ascribed
to it, and been decorated
with offerings long
before the discovery of
America.<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> By that date,
however, the Mexicans
had apparently advanced beyond the earliest stage
of religious development, and expanded the idea of
individual tree-spirits into the more general conception
of a god of vegetation. It was in the honour of such
a god that their May-Day celebrations were held and
their human sacrifices offered. In Nicaragua cereals
were worshipped as well as trees. In more primitive
Patagonia the cruder form of worship persists, a
certain tree standing upon a hill being still resorted
to by numerous worshippers, each of whom brings his
offering.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">

</div>
<p>To return nearer home, the worship of the tree
has prevailed at one time or another in every country
of Europe. It played a vital part in the religion of
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
Greece and Rome, and classical literature is full of
traditions and ideas which can have been derived from
no other source. The subject has been exhaustively
treated by B&ouml;tticher in his <i>Baumkultus der Hellenen</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a>
Mr. Farnell, in his recently published work, says
that in the earliest period of Greek religion of which
we have any record, the tree was worshipped as the
shrine of the divinity that housed within it; hence the
epithet <span title="endendros" class="g">&#7956;&nu;&delta;&epsilon;&nu;&delta;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, applied to Zeus, and the legend of
Helene Dendritis.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> Discoveries made in Crete and
the Peloponnese within the present year (1896) seem
to show that the worship of deities in aniconic shape
as stone pillars or as trees played a great part in the
religion of the Mycenaean period about 1500 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> The
persistent belief of the Greek and Roman peasantry
in the existence and power of the various woodland
spirits is also vitally connected with the primitive
idea of the tree-soul.</p>
<p>In the centre of Europe, covered as it once was
with dense forest, the veneration of the tree tinctured
all the religious usages of the primitive inhabitants.
In ancient Germany, the universal ceremonial religion
of the people had its abode in the &ldquo;<i>grove</i>,&rdquo; and the
earliest efforts of the Christian missionaries were
directed towards the destruction of these venerated
woods, or their consecration by the erection within
them of a Christian edifice.<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> But long after their
nominal conversion the Germans continued to people
every wood with spirits, and the legends and folk-lore
of their modern descendants are still rich in memories
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
of this time-honoured superstition. Some of these
wood-inhabiting spirits were favourable to man, ready
to befriend and help him in difficulty; others were
malicious and vindictive. The whole subject has been
studied in Germany with characteristic thoroughness,
the standard work being Mannhardt&rsquo;s well-known and
fascinating <i>Wald- und Feldkulte</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></p>
<p>In Poland trees appear to have been worshipped
as late as the fourteenth century, and in parts of Russia
the power of the tree-spirit over the herds was so
firmly held, that it was long customary to propitiate
it by the sacrifice of a cow. The Permians, a tribe
related to the Finns, worshipped trees, among other
things, until their conversion to Christianity about 1380
<span class="small">A.D.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a> In parts of Esthonia the peasants even within
the present century regarded certain trees as sacred,
carefully protected them, hung them with wreaths,
and once a year poured fresh bullock&rsquo;s blood about
their roots, in order that the cattle might thrive.<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> In
the remoter parts of the Czar&rsquo;s domain the belief in
tree-demons still persists. They are held to be
enormous creatures, who can change their stature at
will, and whose voice is heard in the clash of the storm
as they spring from tree to tree. In Finland the oak
is still called &ldquo;God&rsquo;s tree,&rdquo; and to this day the birch
and the mountain-ash are held sacred by the peasants,
and planted beside their cottages with every sign of
reverence.</p>
<p>In France at Massilia (now Marseilles) human
sacrifices were, in primitive times, offered to trees.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
In the fourth century of our era there was a famous
pear-tree at Auxerre which was hung with trophies of
the chase and paid all the veneration due to a god.<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a>
In the life of St. Amandus mention is made of sacred
groves and trees worshipped near Beauvais, and
various Church councils in the early middle ages
denounced those who venerated trees, one held at
Nantes in 895 <span class="small">A.D.</span> expressly enjoining the destruction
of trees which were consecrated to demons. Traces
of the ancient worship still survive here as elsewhere
in popular custom; in the south of France they have
a graceful observance, in which the spirit of vegetation
is personified by a youth clad in green, who feigning
sleep is awakened by a maiden&rsquo;s kiss.</p>
<p>In our own islands, as every one knows, the oak-tree
played a salient part in the old Druidical worship,
and Pliny<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a>
even derives the name Druid from <span title="drys" class="g">&delta;&rho;&#8166;&sigmaf;</span>, an
oak, as some still connect it with <i>darach</i>, the Celtic
word for that tree. The important rites with which
the mistletoe was severed from the parent tree and
dedicated at the altar furnish evidence of the veneration
paid to the spirit of the tree, who, according to the
teaching of the Druids, retreated into the parasite-bough
when the oak leaves withered. The Teutons
no doubt brought with them to Britain the religion of
the sacred grove, and we find King Edgar condemning
the idle rites in connection with the alder and
other trees, and Canute fifty years later forbidding
the worship entirely.<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> The ceremonies once connected
with the worship of the tree survived in the form
of a picturesque symbolism long after their origin had
been forgotten. In 1515, at a Twelfth-Night pageant
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
held at his palace of Greenwich by order of Henry
VIII., tree-spirits represented by &ldquo;VIII wylde-men, all
apparayled in grene mosse sodainly came oute of a
place lyke a wood&rdquo; and engaged in battle with the
royal knights.<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a> It was also a custom of this king in
the early years of his reign to resort to the woods with
a richly-apparelled retinue in order &ldquo;to fetche May or
grene bows,&rdquo;&mdash;the spirit of vegetation, whose renewed
vigour was symbolised, unconsciously no doubt, in the
green boughs with which the courtiers decked their
caps.<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> May-day ceremonies to celebrate the new life
in the forest can be traced in England as far back as
the thirteenth century, and the importance still attached
to them by the people as late as the seventeenth
century is indicated by the rancour with which the
Puritans attacked the Maypole, &ldquo;a heathenish vanity
greatly abused to superstition and wickedness.&rdquo; These
and other survivals will be more fully treated in a
later chapter, and are only mentioned here as showing
the ancient prevalence of a belief in tree-spirits, which
indeed is alone competent to account for such customs.</p>
<p>In fine, no one who has not studied the subject
can have any idea of the sanctity associated with the
tree amongst pre-Christian nations. The general
conclusion which B&ouml;tticher gives as the result of his
elaborate research, is that the worship of the tree was
not only the earliest form of divine ritual, but was
the last to disappear before the spread of Christianity;
it existed long before the erection of temples and
statues to the gods, flourished side by side with them,
and persisted long after they had disappeared.<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a> Mr.
Tylor, with greater caution, concludes that <i>direct and
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
absolute tree-worship</i> may lie very wide and deep
in the early history of religion, but that apart from
this &ldquo;there is a wide range of animistic conceptions
connected with tree and forest worship. The tree
may be the spirit&rsquo;s perch, or shelter, or favourite
haunt; or may serve as a scaffold or altar, where
offerings can be set out for some spiritual being; or
its shelter may be a place of worship set apart by
nature, of some tribes the only temple, of many tribes,
perhaps, the earliest; or lastly, it may be merely a
sacred object patronised by, or associated with, or
symbolising some divinity.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> These varied conceptions,
Mr. Tylor thinks, conform, in spite of their confusion,
to the animistic theology in which they all have their
essential principles.</p>
<p>To discuss the origin of tree-worship would
involve the consideration of the whole question
of primitive culture, the theory of animism, and the
subject of ancestor worship, together with a digression
on the very obscure problem of totemism. The last
word has not yet been said on these questions, and
the time has certainly not yet come to say it. As will
be shown in the next two chapters, the general conception
of the tree-spirit includes at least two different
series of ideas, that on the one hand of the tree-god,
whose worship became organised into a definite
religion, and on the other hand that of the tree-demons
or tree-spirits, whose propitiation was degraded
into or never rose above the level of sorcery
and incantation. To define the relation between these
two conceptions is extremely difficult, and it has been
approached by different writers along two different
lines of thought. Either the gods were developed
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
from the spiritual forces assumed by primitive man to
be inherent in nature, and gradually differentiated
from the less friendly powers embodied in the various
demons, until they came to be regarded as the kinsmen
and parents of their worshippers; or they were
ancestral spirits, at once feared and trusted from their
very origin by their kinsmen, whilst all the class of
minor spirits and demons were but degenerate gods
or the ancestral spirits of enemies. The former view
is put forward by Professor Robertson Smith, in a
chapter that deserves most careful study, but he admits
that it is difficult to understand how the friendly
powers of nature that haunted a district in which men
lived and prospered, and were regarded as embodied
in holy trees and springs, became identified with the
tribal god of a community and the parent of a race.<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a>
There is no such difficulty in Mr. Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s
theory that all religion arose from ancestor worship,
or in Mr. Grant Allen&rsquo;s supplementary contention
that trees and stones came to be regarded as sacred
and to be honoured with sacrifices because they were
originally associated with the ancestral grave, and
were hence assumed to have become the haunts or
embodiments of the ancestral spirit.<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> This latter view,
however, does not seem to take sufficient account of
the thousand spirits who, in the belief of primitive
men, thronged the woods, the mountains, and the
springs, and appeared in horrible animal or semi-human
form. Probably the truth lies between the two theories,
and the primitive worship of the tree had more than
one root.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">THE GOD AND THE TREE</span></h2>
<p>When we examine more closely the spiritual beings
who have been thought to haunt or inhabit vegetation,
we find that they fall more or less distinctly into two
classes&mdash;into tree-gods on the one hand, and on the
other into the various tree-demons, wood-spirits,
dryads, elves, jinns, and fabulous monsters common
to the mythology of all countries. There is, perhaps,
no absolutely definite line of demarcation between
the two classes, for primitive thought does not deal
in sharp definitions. But the division, besides being
convenient for our present purpose, is a vital one.
For a god is an individual spirit who enters into
stated relations with man, is mostly if not invariably
regarded as akin to his worshippers, and is presumably
their friend, ally, and protector. Whereas the
demon is an independent and, as a rule, not individualised
spirit, without human kinship, and for the
most part unfriendly to man. The god is to be
revered, approached and called upon by name; the
demon, as a rule, to be dreaded and shunned. The
present chapter will be devoted to the belief in the
tree-inhabiting god.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>The conception of an ubiquitous, unconditioned
spirit is entirely foreign to primitive thought. All
the gods of antiquity were subject to physical limitations.
Those even of Greece and Rome were by
no means independent of a material environment.
There was always some holy place or sanctuary, some
grove, tree, stone, or fountain, or later on some temple
or image, wherein the god was assumed to dwell, and
through which he had to be approached. To Moses
Jehovah is &ldquo;He that dwelt in the bush,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a> and centuries
later Cyrus, while admitting that the Lord of
Israel had made him king of the whole world, yet
speaks of Him as &ldquo;the Lord that dwelleth in Jerusalem.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a>
Very frequently, especially in early times,
this home or haunt of the god was a tree; his ceremonial
worship was conducted beneath its shadow,
and the offerings of his worshippers were hung upon
its branches, or placed at its foot, or upon a table by
its side, and assumed thereby to have reached the
god. Thus the sacred sycamores of Egypt were
believed to be actually inhabited by H&#257;thor, Nu&#788;&icirc;t,
Selk&icirc;t, N&icirc;t, or some other deity, and were worshipped
and presented with offerings as such. The vignettes
in the <i>Book of the Dead</i> demonstrate this belief unmistakably.
They frequently depict the soul on its
journey to the next world coming to one of these
miraculous sycamores on the edge of the terrible
desert before it, and receiving from the goddess of
the tree a supply of bread, fruit, or water, the acceptance
of which made it the guest of the deity and prevented
it from retracing its steps without her express
permission. &ldquo;O, sycamore of the Goddess Nu&#788;&icirc;t,&rdquo;
begins one of the chapters in the <i>Book of the Dead</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
&ldquo;let there be given to me the water which is in
thee.&rdquo; As a rule in the vignettes the bust of the
goddess is represented as appearing from amidst the
sheltering foliage, but sometimes only her arm is seen
emerging from the leaves with a libation-bowl in
the hand. The conception is illustrated still more
clearly on an ancient sarcophagus in the Marseilles
Museum, where the trunk from which the branches
spread is represented as the actual body of the
deity.<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a></p>

<p>As man&rsquo;s conception of the deity became more definitely
anthropomorphic on the one hand and less local
on the other, this primitive representation of the god
in the tree underwent a change in two corresponding
directions. In the one case an attempt was made to
express more clearly the manlike form of the god;
the tree was dressed or carved in human semblance,
or a mask or statue of the god was hung upon or
placed beside it. In the other case, as the god
widened his territory or absorbed other local gods he
became associated with all trees of a certain class, and
was assumed to dwell not in a particular tree, but in
a particular kind of tree, which thenceforward became
sacred to and symbolical of him. This latter idea
received special development in the religions of Greece
and Rome. But in the early history of both those
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
countries cases occur in which a god was worshipped
in an individual tree. At Dodona, which was perhaps
the most ancient of all Greek sanctuaries, Zeus
was approached as immanent in his sacred oak, and
legendary afterthought explained the primitive ritual
by relating that the first oak sprang from the blood of
a Titan slain while invading the abode of the god,
who thereupon chose it as his own peculiar tree.
Again, in ancient Rome,
according to Livy,
Jupiter was originally
worshipped in the form
of a lofty oak-tree which
grew upon the Capitol.
The same was probably
true of other gods at
their first appearance.
Amongst the Greeks,
indeed, the tree was the
earliest symbol or <span title="agalma" class="g">&#7940;&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&mu;&alpha;</span>
of the god, and as such
is frequently represented
on ancient vases, marble
tablets, silver vessels,
and wall-paintings. Indeed, the solitary tree standing
in Attic fields and worshipped as the sacred habitation
of a god was in all probability the earliest Greek
temple, the forerunner of those marvellous edifices
which have aroused the admiration of every subsequent
age; whilst the elaborate worship of which those
temples became the home was presumably based upon
a ceremonial originally connected with the worship
of the tree.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>According to Mr. Farnell, the latest writer on the
subject, the chief gods of the Greeks were in their
origin deities of vegetation, the special attributes
which we associate with them being subsequent accretions.
The pre-Hellenic Cronos gave his name to
an Attic harvest-festival held in July, and his ancient
emblem was the sickle.<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a> Zeus, besides being the oak-god
of Dodona, was worshipped in Attica as a god
of agriculture and honoured with cereal offerings.<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a>
Artemis was not primarily a goddess of chastity, nor a
moon-goddess, nor the twin-sister of Apollo, but an
independent divinity, closely related to the wood-nymphs,
and connected with water and with wild
vegetation and forest beasts. She was worshipped in
Arcadia as the goddess of the nut-tree and the cedar,
and in Laconia as the goddess of the laurel and the
myrtle. Her idol at Sparta was said to have been
found in a willow brake, bound round with withies.
At Teuthea in Achaea she was worshipped as the
goddess of the woodland pasture, and at Cnidus as
the nurturer of the hyacinth.<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a> In the legend of the
colonisation of Boiae she was represented as embodied
in a hare which suddenly disappeared in a myrtle-tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a>
But her character as a tree-goddess comes out still
more clearly in the cult of the &ldquo;hanging Artemis&rdquo; at
Kaphyae in Arcadia,<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> which no doubt grew out of the
primitive custom of suspending a mask or image of the
vegetation spirit to the sacred tree.</p>
<p>The association of Hera with tree-worship is less
pronounced. She was said to have been born under
a willow-tree at Samos, and her worship in that island
was characterised by a yearly ceremony in which her
priestess secreted her idol in a willow brake, where it
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
was subsequently rediscovered and honoured with an
oblation of cakes.<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a> In Argos she was worshipped as
the deity who gave the fruits of the earth, and as such
was represented with a pomegranate in her hand. It
is also worthy of note that the familiar symbol of a
conventionalised tree between two griffins appears on
the stephanos or coronet of the goddess on coins of
Croton of the fourth century, and of certain South
Italian cities, as well as on a colossal bust now at
Venice, which, like the head on the coins, was presumably
copied from the temple-image at Croton.<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a></p>
<p>Aphrodite was not a primitive Greek deity, but
her connection with vegetative life is abundantly clear.
She was, in fact, but a Hellenised variant of the great
Oriental goddess, worshipped in different parts as
Istar, Astarte, Cybele, etc., who was essentially a
divinity of vegetation.<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a></p>
<p>This primitive connection of the gods of Greece
with vegetative life was lost sight of in their later
developments. Even at the date of the Homeric
poems the more advanced of the Greeks had evidently
arrived at &ldquo;a highly developed structure of
religious thought, showing us clear-cut personal divinities
with ethical and spiritual attributes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a> But the
older and cruder ideas of the nature of the gods left
a persistent trace in the ritual with which they were
worshipped, as well as in the designs of the artists who
reflected the popular traditions. Thus the ancient
custom of burning incense before the tree, decking it
with consecrated fillets, and honouring it with burnt
offerings, survived long after the belief of which it
was the natural development had decayed. A sculpture
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
preserved in the Berlin Museum represents the
holy pine-tree of Pan adorned with wreaths and fillets.
An image of Pan is near, and offerings are being
brought to an altar placed beneath it. Again, Theocritus
describes how at the consecration of Helen&rsquo;s
plane-tree at Sparta, the choir of Lacedaemonian
maidens hung consecrated wreaths of lotus flowers
upon the tree, anointed it with costly spikenard, and
attached to it the dedicatory
placard: &ldquo;Honour me, all ye
that pass by, for I am Helen&rsquo;s
tree.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 13.</span>&mdash;Fruit-tree dressed as Dionysus.<br />(B&ouml;tticher, Fig. 44.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The practice of giving the
tree a human semblance, by
clothing it in garments or
carving its stump in human
form, was the natural result
of this worship amongst an
artistic race, groping its way
towards a concrete expression
of its ideas. It represented
the crude strivings of a people
who, in their attempts to
create gods in their own
image, eventually produced
an unsurpassable ideal of human grace and beauty.
From the rudely carved tree-stump arose in due time
the Hermes of Praxiteles. B&ouml;tticher reproduces
several ancient designs in which the trunk of a tree
is dressed as Dionysus. In one of these a mask is
fastened at the top of the trunk in such a way that
the branches appear to grow from the head of the
god, and the trunk itself is clothed with a long
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
garment; a table, or altar, loaded with gifts, stands
beside it.<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a></p>
<p>In other cases, probably where the worshipped tree
had died, its trunk or branches were rudely carved into
an image of the god, and either left <i>in situ</i>, or hewn
down and placed near the temple or, later, in the very
temple itself. Both Pausanias and Pliny state that the
oldest images of the gods were made of wood, and
several Latin authors refer to the custom of thus
carving the branches of auspicious trees (<i>felicium
arborum</i>) as prevalent in primitive times amongst
the Greeks.<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a> The <span title="agalma" class="g">&#7940;&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&mu;&alpha;</span> or emblem of Aphrodite,
dedicated by Pelops, was wrought out of a fresh
verdant myrtle-tree. At Samos a board was the
emblem of Hera; two wooden stocks joined together
by a cross-piece was the sign of the twin-brethren at
Sparta, and a wooden column encircled with ivy was
consecrated to Dionysus at Thebes.<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a></p>
<p>It may be fairly assumed that in cases such as
these the worshippers believed that the dead piece of
wood retained some at least of the power originally
attributed to the spirit dwelling in the living tree.
Their idolatry was but a childish deduction from an
ancient and deeply-rooted theology. The same may
be said for the wood-cutter, derided in the Apocrypha,
who, &ldquo;taking a crooked piece of wood and full of
knots, carveth it with the diligence of his idleness, and
shapeth it by the skill of his indolence; then he giveth
it the semblance of the image of a man, smearing it
with vermilion and with paint colouring it red; and
having made for it a chamber worthy of it, he setteth
it in a wall, making it fast with iron.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a> Side by side
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
with this foolish wood-cutter, who &ldquo;for life beseecheth
that which is dead,&rdquo; may be placed the Sicilian peasant
whom Theocritus represents as offering sacrifice to a
carved Pan. &ldquo;When thou hast turned yonder lane,
goatherd, where the oak-trees are, thou wilt find an
image of fig-tree wood newly carven; three legged it
is, the bark still covers it, and it is earless withal. A
right holy precinct runs round it, and a ceaseless
stream that falleth from the rocks on every side is
green with laurels and myrtles and fragrant cypress.
And all around the place that child of the grape, the
vine, doth flourish with its tendrils, and the merles in
spring with their sweet songs pour forth their woodnotes
wild, and the brown nightingales reply with their
complaints, pouring from their bills their honey sweet
song.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a></p>
<p>This crude worship of the god in the anthropomorphised
tree lingered on amongst the peasantry side
by side with the splendid temple ritual, even into days
when the revelation of a Deity who filled all time and
space, and was worshipped in temples not made with
hands, was rapidly undermining the pagan worship of
the cities. Maximus Tyrius, who lived in the second
century <span class="small">A.D.</span>, and counted among his most diligent
pupils the great Marcus Aurelius, relates how even in
his day at the festival of Dionysus every peasant
selected the most beautiful tree in his garden to
convert it into an image of the god and to worship it.<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a>
And Apuleius, another writer of the same period, bears
similar testimony. &ldquo;It is the custom,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;of
pious travellers, when their way passes a grove or
holy place, that they offer up a prayer for the fulfilment
of their wishes, offer gifts and remain there a
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
time; so I, when I set foot in that most sacred city,
although in haste, must crave for a pardon, offer a
prayer and moderate my haste. For never was
traveller more justified in making a religious pause,
when he perchance shall have come upon a flower-wreathed
altar, a grotto covered with boughs, an oak
decorated with many horns, or a beech-tree with skins
hung to it, a little sacred hill fenced around, or a <i>tree
trunk hewn as an image</i> (<i>truncus dolamine effigatus</i>).&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a></p>

</div>
<p>This custom of carving a tree into the semblance of
a god, and subsequently worshipping it as his sanctuary
or symbol, was current in many parts of the world.
The chief idol form of Osiris, the Did&ucirc; or T&acirc;t, is
believed by Maspero to have originated as a simple
tree-trunk disbranched and planted in the ground.<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a>
Usually it is represented with a grotesque face, beneath
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
four superimposed capitals, with a necklace round its
neck, a long robe hiding the base of the column in its
folds, and the whole surmounted by the familiar
Osirian emblems.</p>
<p>Again, it is said to have been a practice amongst
the Druids, when an oak died to strip off its bark and
shape it into a pillar, pyramid, or cross, and continue to
worship it as an emblem of the god.<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a> The cross
especially was a favourite form, and any oak with two
principal branches forming a cross with the main stem
was consecrated by a sacred inscription, and from that
time forward regarded with particular reverence.</p>
<p>The same custom prevailed in India. In the
seventeenth century there existed near Surat a sacred
banian-tree, supposed to be 3000 years old, which the
Hindus would never cut or touch with steel for fear
of offending the god concealed in its foliage. They
made pilgrimages to it and honoured it with religious
ceremonies. On its trunk at a little distance from the
ground a head had been roughly carved, painted in
gay colours, and furnished with gold and silver eyes.
This simulacrum was constantly adorned with fresh
foliage and flowers, the withered leaves which they
replaced being distributed amongst the pilgrims as
pious souvenirs.<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a></p>
<p>It was predominantly, though by no means exclusively,
a Greek development to associate a particular
god with a particular variety of tree. The oak,
excelling all others in majestic strength and inherent
vigour, became the emblem and embodiment of Zeus.
The connection arose in all probability from the
primitive worship of the Pelasgic Zeus in the oak
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
grove of Dodona, but in classical times it was accepted
throughout Greece. On coins and in other works of
art the god is frequently represented as crowned with
oak leaves, or as standing or sitting beside an oak-tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a>
To have partaken of the acorns of Zeus was a
vernacular expression for having acquired wisdom and
knowledge. This especial sanctity of the oak as the
tree of the father of the gods passed into Italy, and
Virgil speaks of it as&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t13">Jove&rsquo;s own tree</p>
<p class="t0">That holds the world in awful sovereignty.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/i_052.jpg" alt="Fig. 16.&mdash;Apollo on his sacred tripod, a laurel branch in his hand.(From a coin, probably of Delphi.)" width="250" height="249" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 16.</span>&mdash;Apollo on his sacred tripod, a laurel branch in his hand.<br />(From a coin, probably of Delphi.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>More sacred even than the oak to
Zeus was the laurel to Apollo. No
sanctuary of his was complete without
it; none could be founded where the
soil was unfavourable to its growth.
No worshipper could share in his rites
who had not a crown of laurel on his
head or a branch in his hand. As
endowed with the power of the god,
who was at once the prophet, poet,
redeemer, and protector of his people, the laurel
assumed an important and many-sided r&ocirc;le in
ceremonial symbolism.<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a> The staff of laurel in
the hand of the reciting poet was assumed to
assist his inspiration, in the hand of the prophet
or diviner to help him to see hidden things.
Thus the use of the laurel played an essential part
in the oracular ceremonial of Delphi. Everywhere,
in short, the bearing of the laurel bough was
the surest way to the god&rsquo;s protection and favour.
The conception was slow to die. Clement, writing
about 200 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, still finds the warning necessary that
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
&ldquo;one must not hope to obtain reconciliation with God
by means of laurel branches adorned with red and
white ribbons.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a></p>
<p>By an easy transition the laurel became sacred also
to Aesculapius. As the source at once of a valuable
remedy and a deadly poison, it was held in high esteem
by Greek physicians. It was popularly believed that
spirits could be cast out by its means, and it was usual
to affix a laurel bough over the doorway in cases of
serious illness, in order to avert death and keep evil
spirits at bay.<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a></p>
<p>The ceremonial use of the laurel passed from
Greece into Italy. When the Sibylline books were
consulted at Rome, the laurel of prophecy always
adorned the chair of the priest.<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a> Victors were crowned
with laurel, and in Roman triumphs the soldiers
decked their spears and helmets with its leaves.</p>
<p>The tree of Aphrodite was the myrtle.<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a> It was
held to have the power both of creating and of perpetuating
love, and hence from the earliest times was
used in marriage ceremonies. In the Eleusinian
mysteries the initiates crowned themselves with the
oak leaves of Zeus and the myrtle of Aphrodite. The
Graces, her attendants, were represented as wearing
myrtle chaplets, and her worshippers crowned themselves
with myrtle sprays. At Rome Venus was
worshipped under the name of Myrtea in her temple
at the foot of the Aventine. The apple-tree held a
subsidiary but yet important place in the cult of
Aphrodite. Its fruit was regarded as an appropriate
offering to her and, according to Theocritus, played
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
its part in love games.<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a> The apples of Atalanta had
no doubt a symbolical significance.</p>

</div>
<p>Athena also had her special tree. According to
mythology she sprang fully armed from the head
of Zeus, but research into the origins of the gods
makes it much more probable that
her true pedigree was from the olive,
which grew wild upon the Athenian
Acropolis, the chief seat of her worship.
Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan even inclined
to regard the olive as originally the
totem of the Athenians.<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a> At any rate
their connection with that tree dates
from an ancient time. &ldquo;The produce
of the olive-tree had an almost religious
value for the men of Attica, and the physical
side of Greek civilisation much depended on it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a>
From the era of Pericles onwards
the coins of Athens were stamped
with the olive-branch, amongst
other usual accompaniments of the
tutelary goddess. Every sanctuary
and temple of Athena had its
sacred olive-tree, which was regarded
as the symbol of the divine
peace and protection. Naturally
a legend arose to explain the
connection. Athena and Poseidon, being at variance
as to which of them should name the
newly-founded city of Athens, referred the question
to the gods, who in general assembly decreed the
privilege to that claimant who should give the most
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
useful present to the inhabitants of earth. Poseidon
struck the ground with his trident and a horse sprang
forth. But Athena &ldquo;revealed the spray of the gray-green
olive, a divine crown and glory for bright
Athens.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a> And the gods decided that the olive, as
the emblem of peace, was a higher gift to man than
the horse, which was the symbol of war. So Athena
named the city after herself and became its protectress.
This myth, which, according to Mr. Farnell, is one of
the very few creation-myths in Greek folk-lore, was a
favourite subject in art, and is frequently represented
on late Attic coins.<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a></p>
<p>Other gods had their sacred trees: Dionysus, the
vine; Dis and Persephone, the poplar, which was
supposed to grow on the banks of Acheron. The
cypress, called by Greeks and Romans alike the
&ldquo;mournful tree,&rdquo; was also sacred to the rulers of the
underworld, and to their associates, the Fates and
Furies. As such it was customary to plant it by the
grave, and, in the event of a death, to place it either
before the house or in the vestibule, in order to warn
those about to perform a sacred rite against entering
a place polluted by a dead body.<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a></p>
<p>In regard to the number of trees which they held
sacred the Semitic nations rivalled the Greeks. They
venerated &ldquo;the pines and cedars of Lebanon, the
evergreen oaks of the Palestinian hills, the tamarisks
of the Syrian jungles, the acacias of the Arabian
wadies,&rdquo; besides such cultivated trees as the palm, the
olive, and the vine. But there is no clear evidence to
prove that they ever coupled a particular species of
tree with a particular god. In Phoenicia the cypress
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
was sacred to Astarte, but it was equally connected
with the god Melcarth, who was believed to have
planted the cypress-trees at Daphne. &ldquo;If a tree
belonged to a particular deity, it was not because it
was of a particular species, but because it was the
natural wood of the place where the god was worshipped.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a>
It is true that the Chaldaeans regarded
the cedar as the special tree of the god Ea, but the
association was probably borrowed, like the god himself,
from the non-Semitic Accadians, while the connection
of the Nabataean god, Dusares, with the vine
may be traced to Hellenic influence.</p>
<p>Outside the Semitic area individual gods are often
found, as in Greece, linked with particular kinds of trees.
In Persia the cypress was the sacred tree of the
god Mithra, while in Egypt the acacia was intimately
associated with Osiris. On an ancient sarcophagus
an acacia is represented with the device, &ldquo;Osiris shoots
up.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a> And in mortuary pictures the god is sometimes
represented as a mummy covered with a tree or with
growing plants. In both cases the idea of life arising
out of death is probably implied.</p>

<p>In India each Buddha was associated with his
own bodhi-tree or tree of wisdom. The trumpet-flower,
the s&acirc;l-tree, the acacia, the pippala, and the
banian all belonged to different Buddhas, and are
so depicted on the St&ucirc;pa of Bharhut. Here in the
case of the earliest of the Buddhas whose bodhi-tree
has been found, the Buddha Vipasin, the
particular tree represented is the <i>p&acirc;tali</i> or trumpet-flower.
In front of it is placed &ldquo;a throne or bodhi-manda,
before which two people are kneeling, whilst a
crowd of others with joined hands are standing on each
side of the tree.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a> The Buddha Gautama&rsquo;s tree was
the pippala or <i>Ficus religiosa</i>, which is much more
elaborately treated at Bharhut than any other bodhi-tree.
In the sculpture representing its adoration, &ldquo;the
trunk is entirely surrounded by an open pillared
building with an upper story, ornamented with niches
containing umbrellas.
Two umbrellas
are placed
in the top of the
tree, and numerous
streamers are
hanging from the
branches. In the
two upper corners
are flying figures
with wings, bringing
offerings of
garlands. On each
side there is a male
figure raising a
garland in his right
hand and holding
the tip of his
tongue with the thumb and forefinger of his left. In
the lower story of the building is a throne in front of
a tree. Two figures, male and female, are kneeling
before the throne, while a female figure is standing to
the left, and a N&acirc;ga Raja with his hands crossed on
his breast to the right. This figure is distinguished
by a triple serpent crest. To the extreme right there
is an isolated pillar surmounted by an elephant holding
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
out a garland in his trunk. On the domed roof of the
building is inscribed, &lsquo;The Bodhi-Tree of the Buddha
S&acirc;kya Muni.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a> In another sculpture elephants old
and young are paying their devotions to a banian-tree,
while others are bringing garlands to hang on its
branches. The important bearing of these sculptures
on the history of tree-worship is obvious.</p>

<p>It may be noted in passing that neither in the
many sculptured scenes at Bharhut and Buddha
Gaya, all of which are contemporary with Asoka
(<i>circa</i> 250 <span class="small">B.C.</span>), nor even in the much later sculptures
of Sanchi dating from the end of the first century <span class="small">A.D.</span>
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
is there any representation of Buddha, the sole objects
of reverence being st&ucirc;pas (representations of the
tombs of holy men), wheels, or trees. At a later
date the tree appears to have lost its organic connection
with the venerated personage, and to have
preserved only a ceremonial and symbolic significance,
for the Bo-tree, under which truth gradually unfolded
itself to the meditating Gautama, is regarded as sacred
by Buddhists in much the same way as the cross is
by Christians.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt, however, that in the
earliest forms of worship current in India, the alliance
between the plant world and the divine essence was
extremely intimate. The great creative god Brahma,
who, by the light of his countenance, dispelled the
primeval gloom, and by his divine influence evoked
the earth from the primeval ocean, is represented in
Hindu theology as having emanated from a golden
lotus which had been quickened into life when the
spirit of Om moved over the face of the waters.
Again, in Brahminical worship the very essence of
the deity is supposed to descend into his tree. The
tulasi or holy basil of India is believed by the
Hindus to be pervaded by the divinity of Vishnu and
of his wife Lakshmi, and hence is venerated as a god.
It opens the gates of heaven to the pious worshipper,
and those who uproot it will be punished by Vishnu in
time and eternity.<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a></p>
<p>In fact, in the twilight of religion, wherever we
turn, the same idea of a tree-inhabiting god prevails.
In the mythology of Northern Europe the grove of
Upsala, the most sacred spot in all the Scandinavian
peninsula, was the home of Woden, the god who, after
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
hanging for nine nights on the gallows-tree, descended
to the underworld and brought back the prize of
wisdom in the form of nine rune songs.<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a> In the
Middle Ages, according to the rule by which the gods
of one age become the demons of the next, Woden
was converted into Satan, his grove became the
Brocken, and the Valkyrie degenerated into witches.
Taara, the supreme god of the Finns and Esthonians,
was associated with the oak, and the same is true of
the Norse god, Balder, at whose death, we are told,
men, animals, and plants wept. The principal god of
the ancient Prussians was supposed to dwell by
preference in the great oak at Romove,<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a> before which
a hierarchy of priests kept up a continual fire of oak-logs.
The oak was veiled from view, like the pictures
in a modern continental church, and only shown from
time to time to its
worshippers. The grove
where it stood was so
sacred that only the
consecrated were allowed
to enter, and no
branch in it might be
injured.<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a></p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">

</div>
<p>If proof were needed
of the reverence with
which the tree was regarded
in ancient times
and of its hold upon
the reverence of the people, as being the dwelling-place
of the god, it could be found alone in the number
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
of the gifts, which, by the evidence of ancient literature
and art, it was the practice to hang upon its branches
or place about its trunk. In Arabia there was a tree,
identified by Robertson Smith with the sacred acacia
of Nakhla, the
dwelling-place of
the goddess Al-&rsquo;Ozza,
on which
the people of
Mecca at an annual
pilgrimage hung
weapons, garments,
ostrich eggs,
and other offerings.<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a>
It is spoken
of in the traditions
of Mahomet by the
vague name of a
<i>dh&acirc;t anw&acirc;t</i>, or
&ldquo;tree to hang
things on.&rdquo; Another
Arabian tree,
the sacred date-palm
at Nejr&acirc;n,
was also adored
at an annual feast,
and hung with fine clothes and women&rsquo;s ornaments.<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a>
In Egypt, offerings of figs, grapes, cucumbers, etc.
were habitually made to the deities inhabiting the
sycamores.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/i_061.jpg" alt="Fig. 22.&mdash;Sacred tree of Artemis, hung with weapons of the chase.(B&ouml;tticher, Fig. 9.)" width="500" height="713" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;Sacred tree of Artemis, hung with weapons of the chase.<br />(B&ouml;tticher, Fig. 9.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>A similar custom was well known in Greece, as is
proved by the many vases and sculptured tablets in
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
which the tree is shown hung with consecrated fillets
and offerings, while the altar beneath groans with gifts.
Statius, writing in the second century <span class="small">B.C.</span>, describes a
widely celebrated tree, amongst many others similarly
laden, as being covered with bows and arrows, heads
of boars, skins of lions, and huge horns, which had
been dedicated to it as trophies of the chase.<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a> Conquerors,
returning from battle, would hang their
weapons on the sacred tree with a dedication to the
all-powerful Zeus. The arms thus dedicated were
respected even by the enemy.</p>
<p>This custom of making offerings to the tree is no
doubt of great antiquity. In the legend of the Golden
Fleece, Phryxus, having been carried by the fabled
ram across the Hellespont, sacrificed it to Ares, and
hung its priceless fleece on the boughs of a sacred
beech-tree,<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a> whence it was subsequently recovered by
Jason. Such dedication at the shrines of the gods of
something that had been of service and still had value
to the worshipper, was very common in Greek and
Roman worship, and in many cases the tree was the
recipient of the gift.<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a> The rich brought their jewels,
the poor their homely tools and utensils. The fisherman
dedicated his nets in gratitude for an exceptional
catch. The shepherd offered his flute as a welcome
gift to Pan. Some of the dedicatory inscriptions
preserve for us the pathos of the gift. &ldquo;Daphnis, the
flute-player, bowed with shaking age, has here dedicated
his shepherd&rsquo;s staff, too heavy for his weak
hand, to meadow-loving Pan.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a> Lais, grown old,
hangs her too truthful mirror on the sacred tree of
Aphrodite. &ldquo;Take it, O lovely Cytherea; to thee
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
alone is undying beauty given.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a> In the same way
Bacchic revellers, their frenzy past, brought to the
tree the cymbals, robes, and perfumed tresses they had
used.<a class="fn" id="fr_102" href="#fn_102">[102]</a></p>
<p>There is further evidence of the sanctity of the
tree in the important function given to branches and
wreaths in religious ceremonies, a custom which can
find logical explanation only in a precedent tree-worship
deeply rooted in the popular mind. In the
service of the gods of Greece and Rome the wreath
was indispensable. An uncrowned worshipper was in
the position of the man in the parable who had no
wedding garment. And the wreath must have been
taken from the particular tree of the god worshipped,
so that the worshipper might be placed in closest
communion with the deity, and remain inviolate from
molestation while thus clothed with the divine protection.<a class="fn" id="fr_103" href="#fn_103">[103]</a></p>
<p>The carrying of the sacred branch in solemn procession
formed the essential feature in some of the
most important religious festivals of Greece. At the
Daphnephoria, held every nine years at Thebes in
Boeotia in honour of Apollo, the chief post in the procession
was held by the Daphnephorus, or laurel-bearer,
a boy chosen for his strength and beauty. He was
followed to the temple of the god by a chorus of
maidens, also bearing branches and chanting a processional
hymn, and was regarded for the occasion as
the priest of Apollo, who himself bore amongst his
many other appellations that of Daphnephorus, because
he had brought the laurel to Delphi and planted it
there.<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>At the Pyanepsia and the Thargelia, two important
Athenian festivals, the <i>Eiresione</i>, a harvest wreath of
olive or laurel bound round with red and white wool,
and hung with the choicest first-fruits, was borne
about by singing boys, while offerings were made to
the gods.<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a> A vine branch with the grapes upon it
gave its name to another Athenian festival, the Oschophoria,
or grape carrying, held in honour of Dionysus.
A race between chosen youths formed one of the
events of the festival, the competitors running from
the temple of Dionysus to that of Athena, with
boughs in their hands.<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a></p>
<p>Apart, however, from these important festivals, the
use of wreaths or branches was a familiar incident in
the daily life of the Greeks, bearing with it always a
sort of religious significance. The bringer of good
news was rewarded with a wreath; the guests at a
feast were crowned with flowers. No gift to the gods
was complete without its floral accompaniment, and
their statues were often hidden under the wreaths
brought thither as the most acceptable offering.</p>
<p>It can scarcely be doubted that this lavish employment
of blossom and leaf as the expression of a religious
emotion originally sprang from reverence for the tree
as the favourite home of a god. The Greeks, with
their instinctive love for all things beautiful, naturally
pushed this graceful custom further than other races.
But the ceremonial use of branches and flowers was
common throughout the East. The Chaldaean sacred
texts mention the use of &ldquo;green branches&rdquo; in religious
ceremonies.<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a> At the Feast of Tabernacles the Israelites
were enjoined to &ldquo;take the boughs of goodly trees,
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
branches of palm-trees, and the boughs of thick trees
and willows of the brook, and rejoice before the
Lord.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a> The Apocrypha mentions the &ldquo;festal olive
boughs of the Temple.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a> In Persia and Armenia it
was customary to bear a branch when approaching the
god. In Egypt Isis was worshipped with sprays of
absinthe, palm-branches were carried in funeral processions,
and lotus wreaths usually worn at feasts,
whilst in the Assyrian sculptures illustrious persons
are frequently represented holding a flower.<a class="fn" id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a></p>
<p>However little benefit the votaries of trees and
images derived from their observances, apart from the
subjective strength and solace that flow from every
act of worship, there was at least one tangible service
their gods could render them&mdash;the right of sanctuary
and asylum. For the sacred tree, sharing as it did in
the protective power of the indwelling deity, offered
an inviolable refuge to the persecuted and the god&rsquo;s
forgiveness to the sinner who implored it. To have
touched it was regarded amongst the Greeks as
equivalent to having touched an altar or statue of the
god. A branch of it, entwined with the consecrated
fillet, assured its bearer from persecution. Hence a
possible explanation of the legend of the young
Dionysus standing secure amongst the branches of the
sacred tree whilst the flames raged around him.</p>

<p>Frequent references occur in the Classics to tree-sanctuaries.
The Amazons, defeated by Hercules,
found a safe asylum beneath the holy tree at Ephesus,
which was worshipped both as the symbol and temple
of Artemis, before her statue was set up in the tree or
her temple built around it.<a class="fn" id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a> Herodotus relates how
Cleomenes, having burnt the sacred grove of Argos,
together with the five thousand conquered Argives
who had taken refuge there, was visited by the gods
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
with madness for his act of sacrilege.<a class="fn" id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a> Orestes, in his

appears out of the tree to succour him and scare away
his pursuers. The cypress grove on the Acropolis at
Phlius in Peloponnesus was another instance. Fugitives
from justice on reaching it became inviolable, and
escaped prisoners hung upon its trees the chains for
which they had no further use,<a class="fn" id="fr_114" href="#fn_114">[114]</a> just as the modern
cripple, whose limbs have been freed from the prison

<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">WOOD-DEMONS AND TREE-SPIRITS</span></h2>
<p>In nearly all parts of the world, as at nearly all periods
of history, we find evidences of a belief in the existence
of wood-spirits and tree-spirits, which, however they
may differ in outward form, are strangely similar in
their general characteristics. It cannot be asserted of
<i>all</i> these beings that they were regarded as the actual
spirits of individual trees, connected with them as
closely as a man&rsquo;s soul is with his body, but it is
emphatically true of some of them. To the class of
wood-spirits as a whole belong certain at least of the
<i>jinni</i> of Arabia, the woodland spirits of Greek and
Roman mythology, and the wild men and elves of
European folk-lore, besides the tree-inhabiting spirits
of various uncivilised races. Though not always
sharply demarcated from the gods, they differ from them,
as a rule, in being regarded and spoken of generically,
and in not having stated relations with man. Their
alliances are rather with trees, plants, and animals,
whose growth and prosperity are often believed to be
under their protection, and their presence is often
assumed to be expressed in natural phenomena, in the
mysterious sounds of the woods, and in the fury of the
storm. To man they are frequently unfriendly, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
numerous observances, still practised in uncivilised
parts, have arisen from the belief that it was necessary
to propitiate their favour.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, their friendliness to man is directly
proportionate to their human semblance, and this in
its turn would seem to depend on the extent to which
man has been able to conquer the dangers of the
regions where they dwell. The farther back they are
traced the more animal-like and inhuman their appearance.
They preceded the gods and outlasted them,
flourishing in times when these were still animal and
totemistic, and retaining their animal characteristics
long after the gods had become anthropomorphic. To
the peasant mind there was, perhaps, no very clear
distinction between the two classes, and the line between
them has never been an unpassable one, for demons
may develop into gods, just as gods may degenerate
into demons. It is not claimed that all, or indeed
most demons were tree-spirits in their origin, but a
large class of them at any rate were closely associated
with vegetable life and the phenomena that foster or
threaten it.</p>
<p>Chaldaean mythology recognised, side by side with
gods emphatically human, a class of fabulous monsters
who were essentially demons and inferior spirits. There
is not much evidence to couple these monsters with
trees, but in one of the Babylonian hymns the aid of
the gods is invoked against a terrible demon who
&ldquo;makes all creatures hurry in fear,&rdquo; and of whom it is
stated that &ldquo;his hand is the storm-demon, his eye is
filled with the shadow of the forest, the sole of his foot
is the lullub-tree.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_115" href="#fn_115">[115]</a></p>
<p>In the case of the <i>jinni</i> of Arabia the connection
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
with trees is more clearly demonstrable. They were
regarded as hairy monsters, more like beasts than men,
haunting dense, untrodden thickets and endowed with
the power of assuming various shapes. Such an
uncouth and alarming presentment may well have
arisen from their presumed association with places,
which, as the natural lairs of dangerous animals, were
perilous to man, but &ldquo;the association of certain kinds
of <i>jinni</i> with trees must in many cases be regarded as
primary, the trees themselves being conceived as animated
demoniac beings.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_116" href="#fn_116">[116]</a> They have apparently had
a longer career than most demons of the class, for
their existence is still firmly believed in by certain
Bedouins, who asseverate that they have actually seen
them. Mr. Theodore Bent found the same superstitious
dread of the <i>jinni</i> both in the Hadramaut and in
Dhofar. They are described as semi-divine spirits,
who live by rocks near the streams, under trees, or in
the lakes. Mr. Bent could not induce the Bedouins
of his escort to gather a certain water-plant for fear of
offending the <i>jinn</i> of the lake. In fact in the Gara
Mountains the fear of the <i>jinni</i>, and the skill of certain
magicians in keeping them friendly, appear to constitute
the only tangible forms of religion.<a class="fn" id="fr_117" href="#fn_117">[117]</a></p>
<p>Under the word s&#277;&#299;r&#299;m, hairy monsters, E.V.
&ldquo;satyrs&rdquo; and &ldquo;devils,&rdquo; the Bible makes occasional
mention of mythical creatures who were presumably
related to the Arabian <i>jinni</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_118" href="#fn_118">[118]</a> They are represented
as frequenting waste-places, forsaken by man and
given over to nettles and brambles. In one passage
the word is used of the heathen gods of Canaan,<a class="fn" id="fr_119" href="#fn_119">[119]</a> whose
close association with trees has already been noticed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>The fantastic monsters of the Egyptian desert,
thought to appear only at the moment when the minor
functions assigned to them had to be performed, and
at other times to conceal themselves in inanimate
objects, are represented as sometimes dwelling in trees
or in stakes planted in the ground.<a class="fn" id="fr_120" href="#fn_120">[120]</a> Their assumed
complete incorporation in such objects is proved by
the expressive term used by the Egyptians&mdash;the objects
&ldquo;ate them up.&rdquo; Their existence and their unfriendliness
to man were firmly believed in. The shepherd feared
them for his flock, the hunter for himself. Similar
beasts roamed through the Egyptian Hades and
threatened the wayfaring spirits of the dead.</p>
<p>These fragmentary evidences are important as
casting a side-light on the parallel superstitions of the
Aryan races, amongst which, as we shall see, the belief
in wood-demons and tree-spirits was almost universal.</p>
<p>In Greek and Roman mythology there is a whole
gallery of wild creatures inhabiting the mountains
and woods, and more or less closely associated with
vegetable life&mdash;centaurs and cyclops, Pans and satyrs,
fauns and silvani, nymphs and dryads. Mannhardt
has diligently compared these mythical beings with the
wild people and wood-spirits of European folk-lore,
and has clearly demonstrated a remarkable relationship.<a class="fn" id="fr_121" href="#fn_121">[121]</a>
In their evolution they present a distinctly
progressive humanisation. The earliest of them, the
centaurs and cyclops, remind us of the fabulous
monsters of Semitic legend, and their contests with, and
eventual disappearance before the higher powers seem
paralleled in the similar conflict between the gods and
demons of Chaldaea. Mannhardt adduces many arguments
to prove that the centaurs first originated as
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
local wood and mountain spirits. Their earliest haunt
was the thickly wooded Pelion; one of them is
represented as the son of the dryad Philyra or the
linden; another as the son of Melia or the ash. Their
weapons were uprooted trees. Like the European
wild men of the woods they were covered with long
shaggy hair. Chiron, the most friendly of them, was
skilled in the use of simples and in the hidden powers
of nature. Lastly, their presence was assumed in the
whirlwind and other violent atmospheric phenomena.
All these features class the archaic centaurs with the
undoubted wood-spirits of a later mythology. The
same is probably true of the cyclops, whose characteristics&mdash;their
single eye, their use of uprooted trees for
weapons, and their connection with sheep and goats&mdash;may
be paralleled amongst the legendary wood-spirits
of modern Europe.</p>
<p>In later times the place of the extinct centaurs and
cyclops was taken by a tribe, half men half goats,
known as Pan, satyrs, and sileni, who originally were
in all probability local wood-spirits, Pan proceeding
from Arcadia, the satyrs from Argos, the sileni from
Phrygia. In the case of Pan we seem to see a class of
doubtfully amicable wood-spirits developing into a
more or less benevolent god. The Greek poets of the
Periclean age speak of a whole tribe of wood-demons
known as Panes or Panisci, from which eventually an
individual, &ldquo;the Great Pan,&rdquo; seems to have emerged.
The son of a nymph, Pan is called in the Classics
&ldquo;god of the wood,&rdquo; &ldquo;companion of kids,&rdquo; &ldquo;goatherd.&rdquo;
He is represented with horns and goat&rsquo;s legs,
standing beside a sacred oak or pine, a fir-wreath on
his head, and a branch in his hand. He leads the
revels of the satyrs, pipes and dances amongst the
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
wood-nymphs under the trees, and woos a pine-tree
personified as Pithys. Like other wood-spirits he protects
the herds, and, as befits a demon on the way
to apotheosis, is for the most part friendly to man.
But he never, apparently, quite lost his original
character, for he is sometimes classed with incubi and
spirits who cause evil dreams.</p>
<p>The satyr was a degraded, or rather unhumanised
Pan, more sensual and malicious in character, coarser
in feature, and more bestial in form. Hesiod calls the
satyrs &ldquo;a useless and crafty tribe.&rdquo; They were
originally wood-demons, and men represented as satyrs
took part in the festivals of Dionysus, the chief of
vegetation spirits. Silenus, like Pan, the individualised
head of a class, was also closely associated with
Dionysus. The sileni, in fact, were but Phrygian
variants of the satyrs, and are represented in the
Homeric hymn to Aphrodite as consorting with the
hamadryads. In Art they appear clothed in goatskins.
It may be added that the modern Greek
peasant still believes in malicious goat-footed demons
who inhabit the mountains.<a class="fn" id="fr_122" href="#fn_122">[122]</a></p>
<p>In Roman mythology the fauns and silvani played
the same part as Pan and the satyrs in Greece, and
the same confusion existed as to whether they were
individual or generic. The fauns seldom appeared to
mortal sight, but their presence was made known in the
weird noises and the ghostly appearances of the dark
forest. When seen they had horns and goat&rsquo;s feet,
though in a later rendering they are more human in
appearance. They guarded the flocks pasturing in
the woods and, like other wood-spirits, also protected
the cornfield. Silvanus and the silvani, as their name
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
denotes, were tree-spirits even more emphatically than
the fauns. According to Virgil the oldest inhabitants
of Latium allotted to Silvanus a sacred grove and a
special festival;<a class="fn" id="fr_123" href="#fn_123">[123]</a> in later times he was universally
regarded as the patron of the garden and field. At
harvest time an offering of milk was poured over the
roots of his sacred tree. In Art, Silvanus is represented
as covered with hair (<i>horridus</i>) and standing under, or
growing out of a garlanded tree, a crown of pine
sprays on his head, a large pine bough in one hand
and a sickle in the other. An inscription speaks of
him as half enclosed in a sacred ash (<i>sacr&acirc; semiclusus
fraxino</i>). Another account associates the silvani with
the fig-tree, and states that they were called by some
<i>fauni ficarii</i>. Both fauns and silvani had an evil
reputation for their supposed propensity to assault
women, to carry off children, and to disturb the dreams
of sleepers. The peasants of North Italy and Sicily
still believe in wood-spirits, <i>gente selvatica</i>, closely
resembling the old silvani. A Sicilian incantation is
addressed to the spirit of the fig-tree and the devils of
the nut-trees.<a class="fn" id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a></p>
<p>Taking the sum of their characteristics, Mannhardt
is doubtless right in classing these legendary beings
with the wood-spirits met with in the folk-lore of
Northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is, however, in the female counterparts of these
woodland creatures that the idea of an actual tree-soul
is most clearly exemplified. The most striking instance
is the familiar one of the hamadryads, the deep-bosomed
nymphs of wooded Ida, to whose care
Aphrodite entrusted the infant Aeneas, and whose
very name expresses their intimate connection with
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
their trees. To quote the Homeric hymn to Aphrodite,
which was probably written under Phrygian
influence, &ldquo;They belong neither to the mortals nor to
the immortals: they live long, indeed, enjoying immortal
food, and with the immortals they join in the
lordly dance. The sileni mate with them, and Hermes,
too, in the privy recesses of delightful grottoes. With
them, when they were born, upon the mountains lofty
pines and oaks sprang forth from the earth that gives
food to man. Yet when at last the fate of death overtakes
them, first the beautiful trees wither upon the
earth, the bark dies around them, their branches fall
away, and therewith the souls of the nymphs leave the
light of the sun.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a></p>
<p>Pindar, who would appear to have first given them
the name of hamadryads, speaks of them as having
the same length of life as a tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_126" href="#fn_126">[126]</a></p>
<p>But the case of the hamadryads is by no means
an isolated example of the Greek belief in spirits whose
life was bound up with the life of the tree. In the
Homeric hymn to Ceres the nymphs rejoice when the
oaks are in leaf, and weep when their branches become
bare.<a class="fn" id="fr_127" href="#fn_127">[127]</a> Elsewhere a nymph is depicted imploring
that the oak wherein she dwelt should not be hewn
down, and as bringing vengeance on him who ignored
her entreaty.<a class="fn" id="fr_128" href="#fn_128">[128]</a> It was not only the oak and the pine
that might be inhabited by a spirit. Amongst the
names of nymphs that have come down to us is Philyra
(the linden), Daphne (the laurel), Rhoea (the pomegranate),
and Helike (the willow). In later times an
attempt was made in some cases to explain the connection
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
by metamorphosis, a living nymph being supposed
to have been converted into a tree, but it is extremely
probable that this was an inversion of the primitive
nexus.</p>
<p>There are many instances closely parallel to these
classical myths in mediaeval and modern legend. The
story of Alexander and the flower-maidens, for instance,
which was a favourite with the troubadours, and was
subsequently popularised by Lamprecht, and later
by Uhland, was presumably founded on a legend
current in ancient Greece. The story goes that in a
certain wood, when spring came, numbers of enormous
flower buds appeared out of the ground, from each of
which, as it opened, there leapt forth a beautiful maiden.
Their robes were a part of their growth, and in colour
they were just like their flowers, red and white. They
played and danced in the shade, and their singing
rivalled the birds&rsquo;. All past heartaches were wiped
away, and a life of joy and abundance seemed to open
to him who saw them. But it was death for a maiden
to leave her shady retreat and encounter the scorching
sun. When summer was past, and the flowers withered
and the birds were silent, the beautiful creatures died.
Alexander and his knights, coming upon this magical
wood, mated with the flower-maidens, and for more
than three months lived in perfect happiness, till one
by one the flowers faded, one by one the nymphs died,
and the king and his companions had sorrowfully to
resume their travels.<a class="fn" id="fr_129" href="#fn_129">[129]</a></p>
<p>Legends of this sort no doubt provided Lucian
with the motive for that &ldquo;true history&rdquo; of his, wherein
he tells of the wonderful vines growing on the far side
of a certain river that ran wine instead of water.
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
These vines below had a very thick stem, but above
bore maidens&rsquo; bodies of perfect form. Bunches of
grapes grew from their finger-tips, and vine leaves and
grapes formed their hair. They gave the travellers
a friendly greeting, and bade them welcome, most
speaking Greek, others Lydian or Indian. Whoever
accepted their kisses felt a sudden drunken bewilderment.
They shrieked aloud with pain when one
attempted to pluck their grapes. Two of the travellers
who surrendered themselves to their embraces could
not get free again, but took root and budded forth vine
leaves.<a class="fn" id="fr_130" href="#fn_130">[130]</a></p>
<p>The above, of course, was intended as a literary
parody, but stories, not a whit less wonderful, are found
in the folk-lore of many modern countries, and are no
doubt recited and received in good faith. There is a
modern Greek legend, for instance, of a childless wife,
to whom Heaven, in answer to her prayer for children,
sent a golden laurel berry. Despising the gift she
threw it away. From it there grew a laurel-tree with
golden sprays. A prince, following the chase, was so
struck by its beauty that he ordered his dinner to be
prepared beneath it. In the absence of the cook the
tree opened and a fair maiden stepped forth, and after
strewing a handful of salt over his food, withdrew to
the tree, which immediately reinclosed her. The
following day the prince again found his dinner spoilt,
and on the third day he determined to keep watch.
The maid came forth and was captured by the prince
before she could regain her tree. After a time she
escaped, and coming back to the tree called upon it
to open and receive her. But it remained closed, and
she was obliged to return to her prince, with whom,
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
after various mischances, she lived happily for ever
after.<a class="fn" id="fr_131" href="#fn_131">[131]</a></p>
<p>The Czekhs have a similar story of a nymph who
roamed the forest by day, but at night invariably returned
to her willow. She married a mortal and bore
him a child. One day the willow was cut down and
the nymph died. A cradle fashioned out of its wood
had the power of lulling her child to sleep, and when
he grew up he was able to hold converse with his
mother by means of a pipe formed from the twigs
which grew about the stump.<a class="fn" id="fr_132" href="#fn_132">[132]</a></p>
<p>That the soul of the nymph was thought actually to
inhabit the tree is further proved by the belief current
both in ancient and modern myth, that blood would
flow when the tree was injured. It was firmly held in
primitive times that the blood was the very life, the
soul of an animal, and hence in primitive ritual it was
the blood of the sacrifice that was offered to the god.
It is interesting to note that in some cases wine&mdash;&ldquo;the
blood of the grape&rdquo;&mdash;and the juices of fruits and vegetables,
<i>i.e.</i> the vehicle of the plant-soul, were used as
substitutes for blood.<a class="fn" id="fr_133" href="#fn_133">[133]</a> In a later chapter we shall see
that herbs and flowers were fabled to grow from the
blood of the dead and so to re-embody his spirit, and
it will be remembered how Virgil makes the cornel
and myrtle which grew upon the grave of Polydorus at
once bleed and speak when torn up by the hand of
Aeneas.<a class="fn" id="fr_134" href="#fn_134">[134]</a> So Ovid, recounting a similar occurrence in
the case of the dryads&rsquo; oak, sacrilegiously felled by
Eresicthon, was probably only giving a poetic version
of a familiar belief:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t13">He it was</p>
<p class="t0">Whose impious axe mid Ceres&rsquo; sacred grove</p>
<p class="t0">Dared violate her immemorial shades.</p>
<p class="t0">Huge with the growth of ages in its midst</p>
<p class="t0">An ancient oak there stood, itself a grove,</p>
<p class="t0">With votive tablets hung and grateful gifts</p>
<p class="t0">For vows accomplished. Underneath its shade</p>
<p class="t0">The dryads wove their festal dance.</p>
</div>
<p>Eresicthon, in spite of warnings, refused to stay his
hand.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The trembling tree sent forth an audible groan!</p>
<p class="t0">From its pale leaves and acorns died the green,</p>
<p class="t0">Dark oozing sweat from every branch distilled,</p>
<p class="t0">And as the scoffer smote it, crimson-red</p>
<p class="t0">Gushed from the wounded bark the sap, as streams</p>
<p class="t0">When at the altar falls some mighty bull</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t9">Then from its heart</p>

<p class="t0">Find solace for my own.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_135" href="#fn_135">[135]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Mannhardt quotes several mediaeval and modern
instances of the belief in bleeding trees.<a class="fn" id="fr_136" href="#fn_136">[136]</a> And
stories of punishment incurred for destroying a spirit-inhabited
tree are not uncommon in folk-lore. There
is a German legend of an old crone who attempted
to uproot the trunk of an ancient fir-tree. In the
midst of her labours a sudden weakness fell upon
her, insomuch that she was scarcely able to walk.
While endeavouring to crawl home she met a
mysterious stranger, who, hearing her story, at once
pronounced that in her attempts to uproot the tree
she had wounded an elf inhabiting it. If the elf
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
recovered, he said, so would she; if not, she would
die. As the old woman perished that self-same
night we are left to infer that the elf died also.
From India comes a similar recital. While felling
a tree the youthful Satyavant broke out into a
profuse sweat, and overcome with sudden weakness,
fainted and died upon the spot: he had mortally
wounded the indwelling spirit.</p>
<p>Such stories have no doubt arisen from the dread
inspired by wood-spirits amongst all people who
believe in them. In short, the wild inhabitants of
the woods have always retained some of the awe
with which their forerunners, the demons, were regarded.
Often they are credited with quite a wanton
vindictiveness. A Bengal folk-tale tells of a certain
banian-tree haunted by spirits who had a habit of
wringing the necks of all who ventured to approach
the tree by night.<a class="fn" id="fr_137" href="#fn_137">[137]</a> In another Indian story a tree
that grew beside a Brahman&rsquo;s house was inhabited
by a <i>sankchinni</i>, a female spirit of white complexion,
who one day seized the Brahman&rsquo;s wife and thrust
her into a hole in the tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_138" href="#fn_138">[138]</a> Sometimes the tree-spirit
will be wicked and foolish enough to enter
into a human being, and then the exorcist&rsquo;s services
are called in. The presence of the spirit is easily
discovered. The exorcist has only to set fire to a
piece of turmeric root, it being of common knowledge
that no spirit can endure the smell of burning
turmeric.</p>
<p>The Sh&aacute;n&aacute;rs of India believe that disembodied
spirits haunt the earth, dwelling in trees and taking
especial delight in dark forests and solitary places.<a class="fn" id="fr_139" href="#fn_139">[139]</a>
When a Burman starts upon a journey he hangs a
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
branch of plantains or a spray of the sacred <i>Eugenia</i>
on the pole of his buffalo cart, to conciliate any spirit
upon whom he may be unfortunate enough to intrude.
The hunter following his lonely quest in the forest
will deposit some rice and a little bundle of leaves
at the foot of any more than usually majestic tree,
hoping thereby to propitiate the <i>nat</i> or spirit dwelling
therein.<a class="fn" id="fr_140" href="#fn_140">[140]</a></p>
<p>Something of the same fear is felt by the peasants
for the fairies, elves, pixies, and all the tribe of little
people familiar to European folk-lore. These, too, are
all more or less associated with trees, being supposed
to dwell either amongst the branches or in the hollow
trunks. German elves have a partiality for the oak
and elder, and the holes in the trunks are the doorways
by which they pass in and out. A similar idea
exists amongst the Hindus. Though, as a rule, these
forest-elves bear a good character, they are not to be
lightly offended, or more will be heard of it. Hence
prudent country-folk will never injure trees inhabited
by fairies, for when aggrieved they have ample means
of avenging themselves by inflicting some malady or
causing some ill-luck.</p>
<p>Even in England, especially in Devon and Cornwall,
there still exist people who believe that oaks are
inhabited by elves&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Fairy elves, whose midnight revels</p>
<p class="t0">By a forest side or fountain</p>
<p class="t0">Some belated peasant sees.</p>
</div>
<p>And it is not yet quite an obsolete custom to turn the
coat for luck when passing through elf-haunted groves.
It was on St. John&rsquo;s eve that the fairies held their
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
special revels, and in old days many a timorous hand
might be found attaching to his doorway branches of
St. John&rsquo;s wort, gathered at midnight on St. John&rsquo;s
eve, to protect his dwelling from an invasion of
elves. Similarly the peasants living near Mount
Etna never sleep beneath trees on St. John&rsquo;s eve,
lest the spirits who then issue freely from their leafy
dwelling-places should enter into the sleeper.<a class="fn" id="fr_141" href="#fn_141">[141]</a></p>
<p>But it is in Central and North Europe, in the
Tyrol and the Vosges, in the German forests, in
Russia, Scandinavia, and Finland, that the belief in
wood-spirits is most deeply rooted and persistent.
Mannhardt, who has diligently collected an enormous
mass of evidence on the subject, states that traditions
concerning the wild people of the woods are current
in all the more wooded countries of Europe. He
sees in these traditions an amalgamation of the idea
of tree-spirits with that of wind-spirits, and rejects the
hypothesis that they arose out of remembrances of
savage half-bestial aborigines who took to the woods
on the advance of more civilised races.<a class="fn" id="fr_142" href="#fn_142">[142]</a> He thus
summarises the character of the wild people of
Germany, Russia, and Scandinavia. They are often
of gigantic proportions, dwell in woods or mountains,
and originally were no doubt closely connected with
the spirits of trees, their knowledge of &ldquo;simples&rdquo;
and remedies for sick cattle connecting them with
the spirits of vegetation. From head to foot they
are clothed in moss, or covered with rough shaggy
hair, their long locks floating behind them in the
wind. Occasionally they assume an animal form.
They announce their presence in the wind and
tempest. The male spirits carry as weapons uprooted
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
pines or other trees, and in their fights with
each other use tree trunks and pieces of rock. They
are almost invariably of a wanton disposition.<a class="fn" id="fr_143" href="#fn_143">[143]</a></p>
<p>Of all the various spirits of the woods, the moss-woman
of Central Germany appears to be the most
definite example of a tree-spirit. As with the Greek
dryad, her life is bound up with that of a tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_144" href="#fn_144">[144]</a> The
moss-women bear different names and somewhat
different characters in different localities, but the
following description by the author of <i>The Fairy
Family</i> represents the common tradition:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A moss-woman,&rdquo; the haymakers cry</p>
<p class="t0">And over the fields in terror they fly,</p>
<p class="t0">She is loosely clad from neck to foot</p>
<p class="t0">In a mantle of moss from the maple&rsquo;s root,</p>
<p class="t0">And like lichen gray on its stem that grows</p>
<p class="t0">Is the hair that over her mantle flows.</p>
<p class="t0">Her skin like the maple-rind is hard,</p>
<p class="t0">Brown and ridgy and furrowed and scarred;</p>
<p class="t0">And each feature flat like the bark we see,</p>
<p class="t0">When a bough has been lopped from the bole of a tree,</p>
<p class="t0">When the newer bark has crept healingly round</p>
<p class="t0">And laps o&rsquo;er the edge of the open wound;</p>
<p class="t0">Her knotty, root-like feet are bare,</p>
<p class="t0">And her height is an ell from heel to hair.</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes, however, the moss-women and their
relatives the wood-maidens are more friendly to
man, and will help him industriously in the harvest-field;
they have even been known to enter his service
and bring prosperity to all his undertakings.</p>
<p>The wild women of Tyrol, known locally as
Wild-fanggen, are much more terrifying individuals.
Gigantic in stature, their whole body is covered with
hair and bristles, and their face distorted with a mouth
that stretches from ear to ear. They live together in
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
the woods, with which their lives are bound up. If
their special wood is destroyed they disappear; if the
tree from which a fangga takes her name dies or is
felled, she passes out of existence.<a class="fn" id="fr_145" href="#fn_145">[145]</a></p>
<p>The peasants in the Swiss Canton of the Grisons,
which by the way has a &ldquo;wild-man&rdquo; for its heraldic
device, believe in wood-spirits of great strength and
agility, who are skilled in weather-lore and the recovery
of strayed cattle.<a class="fn" id="fr_146" href="#fn_146">[146]</a> The female spirits, some of whom
have been known to marry mortals, are clothed in
skins; but the males, who are hairy, content themselves
with a crown of oak leaves. They are sometimes
helpful to men, but more often mischievous,
having a propensity for stealing the milk and carrying
off the children of the peasants.</p>
<p>The white and green ladies of Franche Comt&eacute;
and Neufchatel belong to the same family, their special
proclivity being to entice men away, to drag them
through brake and brier, and leave them stripped
of their possessions.<a class="fn" id="fr_147" href="#fn_147">[147]</a> In Neufchatel there is a rock,
&ldquo;La roche de la Dame Verte,&rdquo; which young men
are especially warned to avoid; and in the Jura, a
wood where beneath an oak the green ladies are
wont to light a fire, and may be heard singing and
dancing around it. The peasants when they see the
wild flowers and the young corn waving in the wind,
whisper to each other that the green lady is passing
over them with her companions.</p>
<p>The Swedish conception of the tree-spirit is very
similar. He also delights to lead astray those who
intrude upon his forest domain. The well-known
tendency of man, after losing himself, to wander
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
round and round until he regains his starting-place, is
attributed to the wood-spirit. He looks like a man
when you meet him, but touch him and he shoots to
the height of the loftiest tree. You cry out in terror,
and he laughs &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; Hunters seek the friendship
of these lords of the forest, for he who stands
well with them never misses his aim.<a class="fn" id="fr_148" href="#fn_148">[148]</a></p>
<p>The wood-demon of the Russians, Ljeschi, calls
to mind both classical and modern traditions. He is
of human form, with the horns, ears, and feet of a goat,
his fingers are long claws, and he is covered with
rough hair, often of a green colour. He can assume
many forms, and vary his stature at will; in the fields
he is no higher than the grass, in the woods as tall
as the trees. Sometimes he is like a man, clothed
in sheepskins, and often, like the cyclops, with only
one eye. Like other wood-demons, he announces his
presence in the storm and the wind. He springs from
tree to tree, and rocks himself in the branches,
screeching and laughing, neighing, lowing, and barking.
He delights to mislead the traveller and plunge him in
difficulties. However unfriendly to man, Ljeschi is on
good terms with animals; all the birds and beasts of
the wood are under his protection, and the migrations
of squirrels, field-mice, and such small deer are carried
out under his guidance. The peasants are at pains
to propitiate him. In the province of Olonitz the
shepherds offer him a cow every summer, to secure his
favour for the herd; elsewhere the hunter gives him
the first thing he shoots, leaving it for him in an oak-wood,
or places a piece of bread or pancake strewed
with salt upon a tree stump. There are certain ways of
conjuring his presence and his aid by means of birch-twigs,
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
or by uttering a given formula while standing
on a tree-stump, from which it would appear that he is
thought of as dwelling in these vegetable fragments.<a class="fn" id="fr_149" href="#fn_149">[149]</a>
The Russians also believe in female wood-spirits of
terrifying appearance, but they are of less importance
than the male.</p>
<p>In the folk-lore of the Finns the spirits of the
woods bear a more benign character. The chief of
them, &ldquo;Tapio,&rdquo; is termed &ldquo;the gracious god of the
woodlands,&rdquo; and is represented as very tall and
slender, with a long brown beard, a coat of tree moss,
and a high-crowned hat of fir leaves. His consort is
Mielikki, &ldquo;the honey rich mother of the woodland,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the hostess of glen and forest.&rdquo; The neighbouring
Esthonians have their &ldquo;grass-mother&rdquo; who, besides
presiding over the home-field, is also queen of the
woods.</p>
<p>It is not perhaps singular to find that the traditions
with regard to wood-spirits current amongst
contiguous peoples should exhibit such a strong
resemblance to each other, but when almost exactly
the same conceptions are met with in such distant
parts as Japan and South America, we can only
conclude that the human mind, wherever it exists,
is similarly constituted, and, granted the same phenomena,
falls back upon the same ideas to explain them.</p>
<p>The Tengus of Japanese legend have many of the
characteristic marks of the wood-spirit. They dwell
in the topmost branches of lofty trees, are skilled in
the language and lore of animals and plants, and are a
terror to untruthful children. They have the body of
a man, the head of a hawk, with a long proboscis, and
powerful claws on their hands; on their feet, also
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
provided with claws, are stilt-like clogs a foot high.
They are hatched from eggs, and in their youth have
feathers and wings.<a class="fn" id="fr_150" href="#fn_150">[150]</a></p>
<p>A traveller in Peru only sixty years ago found the
tradition of a living wood-ghost, who dwelt in the
darkest part of the forest, the haunt of night-birds, and
issued forth to decoy the Indians to their destruction.<a class="fn" id="fr_151" href="#fn_151">[151]</a>
The idea of a wild man of the woods also exists in
Brazil. The Indians call him Curupira, and attribute
to his agency all such forest sounds as they cannot
understand.<a class="fn" id="fr_152" href="#fn_152">[152]</a></p>
<p>Some of the foregoing traditions present a glimpse
of the transition towards a later and more highly
developed conception, in which the many spirits once
believed in become generalised into a single &ldquo;spirit
of vegetation.&rdquo; It is not indeed contended that this
belief is necessarily destructive of the earlier. Indeed
it is possible that in the loosely working mind of the
peasant the two conceptions may exist side by side.
The many interesting ceremonies and observances
which arose out of this generalised conception will be
dealt with in a later chapter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE TREE IN ITS RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE</span></h2>
<p>Having dealt with the Tree in its connection on the
one hand with gods, and on the other with spirits of
more equivocal attributes, we have now to consider
a series of myths and traditions wherein it was
regarded as entering into a still more intimate relationship
with man. Sometimes it was represented as the
source from which the human race originally sprang,
sometimes, conversely, as the object into which the
soul might retreat after death, or into which an
individual might be transmuted, body and soul, by
some miraculous agency. In other cases the life of a
particular tree was held to be bound up with that of an
individual or a community, and lastly, in a still larger
conception, the tree came to be very widely regarded
as the embodiment of the spirit of fertility, the especial
patron of the field and flock.</p>
<p>To the modern mind, which claims to have deciphered
Nature&rsquo;s scattered hieroglyphs, and finds a
genealogical document even in the evanescent wrinkles
on a baby&rsquo;s foot, the idea of man taking origin from a
tree will seem in the highest degree fantastic, but to
the primitive intelligence it probably presented no
greater difficulty than the extraction of the new baby
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
from the parsley bed does to the modern child. The
early inquirer may well have found in it the most
natural answer to the eternal riddle, &ldquo;Whence came
our first parents?&rdquo; the most plausible solution to the
strange problem of man&rsquo;s separate existence upon the
globe, supplying the necessary link between him and
the great mother-earth, which supported and fed him
while alive, and received him again into her bosom
when dead. Speculation apart, however, the solution
would appear to have commended itself to many
different inquirers, for the belief that the human race
took its first origin from trees is met with in the
mythology of the most widely separated races.</p>
<p>Thus we read in the Eddas that when heaven and
earth had been made, Odin and his brothers walking
by the sea-shore came upon two trees. These they
changed into human beings, male and female. The
first brother gave them soul and life; the second
endowed them with wit and will to move; the third
added face, speech, sight, and hearing. They
clothed them also and chose their names, Ask for the
man&rsquo;s and Embla for the woman&rsquo;s. And then they
sent them forth to be the parents of the human
race.<a class="fn" id="fr_153" href="#fn_153">[153]</a></p>
<p>Again, according to the Iranian account of the
creation the first human couple, Maschia and
Maschi&acirc;na, issued from the ground in the form of a
rhubarb plant (the <i>Rheum ribes</i>), which was at first
single, but in process of time became divided into two.<a class="fn" id="fr_154" href="#fn_154">[154]</a>
Ormuzd imparted to each a human soul, and they
became the parents of mankind.</p>
<p>In the corresponding legend current amongst the
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
Sioux of the Upper Missouri<a class="fn" id="fr_155" href="#fn_155">[155]</a> one seems to catch an
echo from the Garden of Eden. Here the original
parents, like the trees from which they developed, at
first stood firmly fixed to the earth, until a monster
snake gnawed away the roots and gave them independent
motion, just as in Paradise the serpent destroyed
the harmony and mutual trust which united Adam
and Eve.</p>
<p>The classical nations possessed a similar tradition.
According to Hesychius it was believed by the Greeks
that the human race was the fruit of the ash, and
Hesiod relates that it was from the trunks of ash-trees
that Zeus created the third or bronze race of men.<a class="fn" id="fr_156" href="#fn_156">[156]</a>
The oak was particularised as the favoured tree in
another tradition. &ldquo;Whence art thou?&rdquo; inquires
Penelope of the disguised Ulysses, &ldquo;for thou are not
sprung of oak or rock, as old tales tell.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_157" href="#fn_157">[157]</a> Virgil, too,
speaks of</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nymphs, and fauns, and savage men, who took</p>
<p class="t0">Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak.<a class="fn" id="fr_158" href="#fn_158">[158]</a></p>
</div>
<p>The Damaras of South Africa believe that the
universal progenitor was a tree, out of which came
Damaras, Bushmen, oxen and zebras, and everything
else that lives.<a class="fn" id="fr_159" href="#fn_159">[159]</a></p>
<p>In other legends human beings are represented as
arising from the tree as its fruit. The first book of
the <i>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</i> tells of an enormous Indian fig-tree
from whose branches hung little devotees in human
form; and an Italian traveller of the fourteenth
century was assured by the natives of Malabar that
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
they knew of trees, which instead of fruit bore pigmy
men and women. So long as the wind blew they
remained fresh and healthy, but when it dropped they
became withered and dry.<a class="fn" id="fr_160" href="#fn_160">[160]</a> A somewhat similar tradition
was familiar to the Arab geographers, who tell
of a talking tree growing at the easternmost point of
the habitable world, which bore young women on its
branches in place of fruit.<a class="fn" id="fr_161" href="#fn_161">[161]</a> And even to the present
day folk-tales of Saxony and Thuringia speak of
children as &ldquo;growing on the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another class of origin-myths <i>individual</i> births
are represented as taking place directly from a tree.
Adonis came forth at the stroke of a sword from the
tree into which his mother, the guilty Myrrha, had
been transformed in answer to her prayers.<a class="fn" id="fr_162" href="#fn_162">[162]</a> The
Phrygian Attis, according to one version, was fathered
by an almond-tree; while, according to another, his
body was confined by Cybele in a pine-tree, from
which on the return of spring he was born again.<a class="fn" id="fr_163" href="#fn_163">[163]</a>
The Khatties of Central India claim to be descended
from a certain Khat, &ldquo;begotten of wood,&rdquo; who, at the
prayer of Karna, an illegitimate brother of the five
sons of P&acirc;ndu (heroes of the <i>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</i>), sprang
from the staff he had fashioned from the branch
of a tree to assist him against his legitimate kinsmen.<a class="fn" id="fr_164" href="#fn_164">[164]</a></p>
<p>The above examples prove how widely the conception
prevailed that human beings or man-like spirits
might owe their first origin to the tree. In a later
stage these crude myths were rationalised in three
directions. In one the tree came to be, not the
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
source, but the scene of a miraculous birth; in another
its supposed connection with a human being was explained
by a metamorphosis legend; and, thirdly, the
tree came to be regarded as the symbol and minister
of fecundity.</p>
<p>Many of the gods of Greece were born or brought
up, according to tradition, at the foot of some tree,
whence B&ouml;tticher argues that their worship was
founded on a pre-existing tree-cult. Rhea gave birth
to Zeus beneath a poplar in Crete, and the ruins of her
temple in an adjoining cypress grove were shown even
up to the Augustan age.<a class="fn" id="fr_165" href="#fn_165">[165]</a> The people of Tanagra
asserted that the young Hermes was reared amongst
them under a purslane-tree (<i>andrachnos</i>), the remains
of which were for long treasured in the temple of the
god as a sacred souvenir of the institution of his
worship.<a class="fn" id="fr_166" href="#fn_166">[166]</a> Hera was born and brought up under a
willow in Samos, described by Pausanias, who saw
it still in leaf, as the most ancient of the sacred trees
known to the Greeks.<a class="fn" id="fr_167" href="#fn_167">[167]</a> Leto gave birth to Apollo and
Artemis in the island of Delos while clasping two
trees, by some authorities particularised as an olive
and a palm, by others, under the idea that Apollo
must have been born at the foot of his own tree, as
two laurels.<a class="fn" id="fr_168" href="#fn_168">[168]</a> Romulus and Remus were found under
the <i>Ficus ruminalis</i> by the Tiber, and in later days
were worshipped in the Comitium beneath a sapling
from that tree. The same idea is met with in the
mythology of other nations. Vishnu was born beneath
the pillared shade of the banian; Buddha was born
and died under a s&acirc;l-tree.</p>
<p>The converse of these origin myths is represented
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
in the numerous legends of metamorphosis and transmigration.
The well-known story of Apollo and
Daphne seems to supply an instance of the way in
which the metamorphosis story arose to explain a more
primitive connection, the meaning of which had been
lost. It is an established fact that the laurel was held
sacred in Greece as connected with earth-oracles
before the worship of Apollo was introduced. A
sacred laurel grew by the prophetic cleft at Delphi in
the days when the earth-goddess, Gaia, still presided
over the oracle, and according to tradition the goddess&rsquo;
daughter, Daphne, a mountain nymph, was
priestess under her.<a class="fn" id="fr_169" href="#fn_169">[169]</a> The story which explains the
transference of the oracular power from Gaia to
Apollo tells how Daphne, fleeing before the god,
entreats her mother, Earth, to save her; the ground
opens to receive her, and in her place a laurel appears.
Apollo, balked of his love, cries: &ldquo;If thou may&rsquo;st
not be my wife, thou shalt for ever be my tree,&rdquo; and
henceforward he makes the laurel his sanctuary, and
crowns his head and his lyre with its leaves. Thus he
steps into her mother&rsquo;s place, and the laws of Zeus&mdash;the
old earth-oracles under a new name&mdash;are proclaimed
through him.</p>
<p>The story is one of the many folk-tales concerning
the conversion of mortals into trees which Ovid has
so gracefully elaborated in his <i>Metamorphoses</i>, and
which assume a new importance now that we can trace
them back into that old world when tree and man, and
indeed all living things, were held to be so near akin.
How far they owed their origin to the desire to find a
new sanction for the traditional tree-worship by investing
it with a human interest, it is impossible to say.
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
It is sufficient for us that they demonstrate the survival
of very ancient modes of thought amongst races who
had otherwise reached a high degree of civilisation.
They were amongst the miracles of classical antiquity,
and like other miracles, if they prove nothing else,
they at least afford invaluable evidence as to the state
of mental culture amongst those who found them
credible.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting of these metamorphosis
legends concerns the fate of the three daughters of
the Sun and Clymene, who were so heart-broken at
the tragic fate of their brother Pha&euml;ton that they were
changed into poplars by the banks of the stream into
which he had been hurled,&mdash;the Eridanus or Po. The
tears they shed were preserved in the form of amber:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t11">As she bent</p>
<p class="t0">To kneel, Pha&euml;thusa, eldest born, her feet</p>
<p class="t0">Felt stiffen, and Lampeti&euml;, at her cry</p>
<p class="t0">Starting, took sudden root, and strove in vain</p>
<p class="t0">For motion to her aid. The third, her hair</p>
<p class="t0">In anguish tearing, tore off leaves! And now</p>
<p class="t0">Their legs grow fixed as trunks, their arms as boughs</p>

<p>The story of Baucis and Philemon&mdash;the worthy
peasants who so hospitably entertained the gods, Zeus
and Hermes, disguised as travellers, that their cottage
was changed into a temple and they themselves into
its priest and priestess&mdash;is more familiar. Their
prayer that neither should witness the death of the
other was fulfilled by the gods, by means of a device
familiar enough to the folk-lore of the time:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">As one morn upon the hallowed steps,</p>
<p class="t0">Bowed now with years, they stood, and to a knot</p>
<p class="t0">Of wondering hearers told the Temple&rsquo;s tale,</p>

<p class="t0">Attested to these ears. The honoured boughs</p>
<p class="t0">Myself have seen with garlands decked, myself</p>
<p class="t0">One garland added more.<a class="fn" id="fr_171" href="#fn_171">[171]</a></p>
</div>
<p>In many cases metamorphosis legends were attached
to particular kinds of trees, thereby no doubt
reinforcing the reverence and affection with which
they were regarded. The Greek name for the almond
tree, &ldquo;Phylla,&rdquo; recalled the fate of Phyllis, the beautiful
Thracian, who hanged herself in despair when she
thought Demophoon had deserted her, and was
changed by the gods into one of these trees. Shortly
afterwards the truant lover returned, heard the sorrowful
tidings, visited the tree, and embraced it with
tears. Then suddenly its branches, which till then
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
had remained bare, burst forth into blossom and
verdure, as if to show how joyfully conscious they
were of the beloved&rsquo;s return. Melus, priest of Aphrodite,
filled with grief at the death of his foster-son
Adonis, hanged himself, and was changed by the goddess
he served into an apple-tree, from which time
forward the apple came to be regarded as the most
acceptable gift that a lover could offer at her shrine.
Lotis, a beautiful nymph, pursued by Priapus, threw
herself on the mercy of the gods, and by them was
changed into the lotus-tree.</p>
<p>The pine-tree, into which Cybele, in a moment of
anger, had changed her lover and devotee, Attis,
owed its perennial verdure to the compassion of Zeus
for her remorse. The pomegranate was connected in
tradition with a certain maid whom Dionysus loved,
and the crown-like form of its blossom was accounted
for by the story that the god, before he changed her
into a tree, had promised her that she should one
day wear a crown. The frankincense-tree owed its
virtue to the nectar and ambrosia scattered by Apollo
on the tomb of Leucothea, who had secured his love,
and in consequence had been buried alive at the
instance of her rival, Clytia. The tree grew from her
grave, and Clytia, pining away in turn from grief, was
changed into a plant whose blossoms were destined
henceforth, like our sunflower, perpetually to confront
the sun, her faithless lover.</p>
<p>The vicarious immortality which the jealous but
faithful Clytia thus secured was shared by other
fabled personages, many of whom, according to that
poetical sentiment which is begotten of all that is
gentle and beautiful in nature, were changed into
flowers. The idea is indeed a graceful one. For a
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
beautiful youth or maiden, dying young and unhappy,
no better recompense than such a flower-change
could be imagined by a people, full indeed
of the instinctive craving for immortality, but
vague in their assurance of a life beyond the
grave.</p>
<p>The nymphs who, hearing of the sad death of the
beautiful Narcissus, hurried to perform his obsequies,
found that he had been changed into a flower, the cup
of which was filled with the tears that he had shed.
&ldquo;Bid daffodillies fill their cups with tears,&rdquo; sings
Milton, using the old English name for the narcissus.
Rhodanthe, the universal praise of whose beauty had
aroused the jealous anger of Artemis, was changed by
Apollo into the rose. The pipe of Pan was fashioned
from the reeds into which the nymph, Syrinx, had been
transformed by her sister nymphs in their determination
to rescue her from the god&rsquo;s unwelcome overtures.</p>
<p>There are many instances in classical mythology
wherein flowers were believed to have arisen from the
blood, <i>i.e.</i> the very life, of dying persons. The violet
sprang from the blood of Attis when Cybele changed
him into a pine-tree. From the blood of Hyacinthus,
killed in anger by Zephyrus, Apollo caused the
hyacinth to grow. Acis, crushed to death by Polyphemus,
was changed into a stream, but from his
blood there sprang the flowering rush. According to
the Egyptians the vine arose from the blood of the
Titans.</p>
<p>In other cases tear-drops were, so to speak, the
seed of the miracle. The anemone grew from
the tears that Aphrodite shed at the death of
Adonis:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Woe, woe for Cytherea, he hath perished, the lovely Adonis.</p>
<p class="t0">A tear the Paphian sheds for each blood-drop of Adonis,</p>
<p class="t0">And tears and blood on the earth are turned to flowers.</p>
<p class="t0">The blood brings forth the rose; the tears, the wind-flower;</p>
<p class="t0">Woe, woe for Cytherea, he hath perished, the lovely Adonis!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_172" href="#fn_172">[172]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Shakespeare, it will be remembered, gives to the
anemone the magical power of producing love.<a class="fn" id="fr_173" href="#fn_173">[173]</a></p>
<p>The legendary lore of the East contains traditions
similar to those above mentioned, of which it will be
sufficient to cite the following:&mdash;The Burmese believe
that the <i>Canna Indica</i> or Indian shot sprang from the
sacred blood of the Buddha. His evil-minded brother-in-law,
incensed at not being allowed to hold a separate
assembly of his own, rolled down a rock upon the
teacher from a lofty hill. A fragment bruised the
Buddha&rsquo;s toe, and drew from it a few drops of blood,
from which the sacred plant arose.<a class="fn" id="fr_174" href="#fn_174">[174]</a></p>
<p>In another class of legends, more characteristic of
mediaeval than of classical mythology, the <i>soul</i> of the
dead person was believed to pass into a tree. They
are, in fact, cases rather of metempsychosis than of
metamorphosis. A legend current in Cornwall tells
how, after the loss of her lover, Iseult died broken-hearted,
and was buried in the same church with
Tristram, but by the king&rsquo;s decree at some distance
from him. Soon ivy sprang from either grave, and
each branch grew and grew until it met its fellow at
the crown of the vaulted roof, and there clasped it and
clung to it as only ivy can.<a class="fn" id="fr_175" href="#fn_175">[175]</a> In another version the
plants that sprang from the graves of the lovers
were a rose and a vine. The same idea is met with in
the familiar ballad of Fair Margaret and Sweet William.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Margaret was buried in the lower chanc&egrave;l,</p>
<p class="t">And William in the higher;</p>
<p class="t0">Out of her breast there sprang a rose,</p>
<p class="t">And out of his a brier.</p>
<p class="t0">They grew till they grew into the church top,</p>
<p class="t">And then they could grow no higher;</p>
<p class="t0">And there they tyed in a true lover&rsquo;s knot,</p>
<p class="t">Which made all the people admire.<a class="fn" id="fr_176" href="#fn_176">[176]</a></p>
</div>
<p>A story is told in Japan of a faithful couple who,
after enjoying long years of happiness, died at last at
the same moment; their spirits withdrew into a tall
pine-tree of great age, which a god had once planted
as he passed that way. On moonlight nights the
lovers may be seen raking together the pine-needles
under the tree, which to this day is known as the
Pine of the Lovers.<a class="fn" id="fr_177" href="#fn_177">[177]</a></p>
<p>A certain Chinese king had a secretary, Hanpang,
for whose young and beautiful wife he conceived a
violent passion. Failing in his designs upon her, the
king threw Hanpang into prison, where he shortly
died of grief. His wife, to escape the royal suit, threw
herself from a lofty terrace, having entreated as a last
favour that she might be buried beside her husband.
The king in his anger ordered otherwise. But that
same night a cedar sprang from each grave, and in
ten days they had become so tall and vigorous in their
growth that they were able to interlace both branch
and root, and the people called them the Trees of
Faithful Love.<a class="fn" id="fr_178" href="#fn_178">[178]</a></p>
<p>In Germany the following story is told to explain
why a certain blue flower, the endive, which grows
by the roadside, is called the &ldquo;Wegewarte&rdquo; or way-watcher.
A maiden, eagerly anticipating the return
of her lover from a long voyage, visited every morning
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
and evening the spot where they had parted, and
anxiously paced the road, awaiting his coming. At
last, worn out by her long vigil, she sank down by the
wayside and expired. On the spot where she breathed
her last the flower appeared.<a class="fn" id="fr_179" href="#fn_179">[179]</a></p>
<p>There is a Japanese story in which a mother is
represented as hearing her dead son&rsquo;s voice in the
sighing of a sacred willow which grew above his
grave.<a class="fn" id="fr_180" href="#fn_180">[180]</a> Grimm quotes other examples.<a class="fn" id="fr_181" href="#fn_181">[181]</a> In the song
of Roncesvalles, a blackthorn grows above the dead
Saracens, a white flower above the dead Christians.
In other legends white lilies grow from the graves of
persons unjustly executed. From a maiden&rsquo;s grave
grew three lilies which none but her lover might pluck.</p>
<p>In all these legends we have a survival of very
primitive ideas about the soul, ideas out of which
subsequently arose the formal doctrine of transmigration.
The immortality of the soul was accepted, but
there was always an inclination to quarter it in some
new living thing. The instances above given, in
which it was thought to pass into some plant, especially
concern us, as illustrating the primitive belief that
trees and shrubs might contain a spirit in human form.</p>
<p>A further derivative of the assumed kinship between
human and vegetable life is the conception of the tree
as sympathetically interwoven with the life and fortunes
of an individual, a family, or a community. &ldquo;In folktales
the life of a person is sometimes so bound up
with the life of a plant that the withering of the plant
will immediately follow or be followed by the death of
the person. Among the M&lsquo;Bengas in Western Africa,
about the Gaboon, when two children are born on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
same day the people plant two trees of the same kind
and dance round them. The life of each of the
children is believed to be bound up with the life of one
of the trees, and if the tree dies or is thrown down
they are sure that the child will soon die. In the
Cameroons, also, the life of a person is believed to be
sympathetically bound up with that of the tree. Some
of the Papuans unite the life of a new-born child sympathetically
with that of a tree, by driving a pebble into
the bark of the tree. This is supposed to give them
complete mastery over the child&rsquo;s life; if the tree is cut
down the child will die.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_182" href="#fn_182">[182]</a> According to the Talmud,
the destruction of Bithar, in which four hundred thousand
Israelites lost their lives, originated in the resentment
of one of its inhabitants at the wanton destruction
of a young cedar-tree, which, according to the custom
of the place, he had planted at the birth of his child.<a class="fn" id="fr_183" href="#fn_183">[183]</a></p>
<p>It was usual amongst the Romans to plant a tree
at the birth of a son, and from its vigour to forecast
the prosperity of the child. It is related in the
life of Virgil, that the poplar planted at his birth
flourished exceedingly, and far outstripped all its contemporaries.
A similar superstition has persisted even
into times that are almost contemporary. Lord Byron,
for all his scepticism, had the idea that his life and
prosperity depended on the fate of an oak which he
had planted when he first visited Newstead.<a class="fn" id="fr_184" href="#fn_184">[184]</a></p>
<p>The mystical relationship of man and tree is further
illustrated in an old German belief quoted by Mannhardt,
that a sick child placed in a hole made in a tree
by sawing off a branch, or by splitting it open with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
wedge, will recover as soon as the tree-wound heals.
Should the child die and the tree survive, the human
soul will inhabit the tree for the rest of its life.<a class="fn" id="fr_185" href="#fn_185">[185]</a></p>
<p>The family tree and the community tree were
merely extensions of this conception. The heroic
descendants of Pelops regarded the plane-tree as
especially sacred to them and bound up with their
fortunes, and in later times we find families taking
their names from trees. Mannhardt quotes in this
connection the German surnames Linde, Holunder,
Kirschbaum, Birnbaum, etc.<a class="fn" id="fr_186" href="#fn_186">[186]</a></p>
<p>But more important than the family tree is the
community tree. In many an old German village there
stood a tree, often a May-tree, which the villagers
guarded as the apple of their eye. It was looked
upon as the life-tree, the tutelary genius, the second
&ldquo;I&rdquo; of the whole community. Devotions were paid
to it and gifts offered as to a deity.<a class="fn" id="fr_187" href="#fn_187">[187]</a> The ancient fig-tree
in the Comitium at Rome, already alluded to as a
supposed descendant of the very tree under which
Romulus and Remus were found, is another case in
point.<a class="fn" id="fr_188" href="#fn_188">[188]</a> It was held to be closely connected with the
fortunes of the city, and Tacitus describes the terror
of the Romans when, in the reign of Nero, it suddenly
began to flag and wither, and their relief when, upon
the Emperor&rsquo;s death, it was found to have renewed its
vigour.<a class="fn" id="fr_189" href="#fn_189">[189]</a> Pliny tells of two myrtle-trees, called the
Patrician and Plebeian, which grew before the temple
of Quirinus at Rome. As sacred to Venus, and hence
symbolical of union, these trees were held to represent
the amity which existed between the two orders. At
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
first they had grown with equal vigour, but when the
patricians began to encroach upon the power of the
plebs their tree outgrew the other, which languished
beneath its baleful shadow. After the Marsian war,
however, from which date the power of the Senate
began to decline, it was noticed that the patrician tree
showed signs of age, while the plebeian sprouted forth
with new vigour.<a class="fn" id="fr_190" href="#fn_190">[190]</a> Curiously enough, there is, or was
so recently as 1885, an old tree in Jerusalem, opposite
Cook&rsquo;s office, belonging to an old family and protected
by the Sultan&rsquo;s firman, which the Arabs consider will
fall when the Sultan&rsquo;s rule ends. &ldquo;It lost a large
limb during the Turco-Russian war, and is now
(1885) in a decayed state.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_191" href="#fn_191">[191]</a></p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">

</div>
<p>From conceptions such as these the transition is
easy to that wider view which
regarded the tree as the material
representative of the mysterious
feminine reproductive power, the
good genius of general prosperity.
We know that the Semitic nations
worshipped under various names a
great mother-goddess, the progenitrix
of gods and men, and there is
evidence to show that the tree
was widely venerated as her divine
symbol. In the coins of Heliopolis (Baalbek), where this
great deity was worshipped under the name of Astarte,
the figure of the goddess under the peristyle of her
temple is sometimes replaced by a pyramidal cypress.
In a coin of Myra, in Lycia, the bust of a goddess is
represented in the foliage of a tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_192" href="#fn_192">[192]</a> The goddess,
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
who is of the veiled archaic type and wears on her
head the <i>calathus</i>, the symbol of fertility, is identified
by Mr. Farnell with Artemis-Aphrodite, &ldquo;who is here
clearly conceived as a divinity of vegetation.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_193" href="#fn_193">[193]</a> The
Canaanites, and under their influence the Israelites,
worshipped Ashtaroth, the fruitful goddess, under the
symbol of an <i>ash&ecirc;ra</i>, a tree or pole,
decked with fillets, like the May-tree.
An ancient Babylonian cylinder represents
a decorated tree with a
worshipper beside it, who in the
inscription invokes the goddess as
her servant.<a class="fn" id="fr_194" href="#fn_194">[194]</a> On other cylinders
the tree-symbol sometimes accompanies
and sometimes replaces the
figure of Istar, the great procreative
goddess more or less related to the
goddess of the <i>ash&ecirc;rim</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_195" href="#fn_195">[195]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 25.</span>&mdash;Sacred tree and worshipper.<br />(Goblet d&rsquo;Alviella.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The conception of the tree as the symbol of fertility
seems to be still more clearly emphasised in the Assyrian
cylinders and bas-reliefs, where it is conventionally
represented as a date-palm between two personages,
who approach it from either side bearing in their
hands a cone similar to the inflorescence of the male
date-palm. Mr. Tylor suggests that these personages,
variously represented as kings or priests, genii with
wings and heads of eagles, or mythical animals, may
represent the fertilising winds or divinities, whose procreative
influence was typified by the artificial fecundation
of the palm, a procedure which is necessary
for its successful culture, and which we know from
Herodotus to have been familiar to the

Babylonians.<a class="fn" id="fr_196" href="#fn_196">[196]</a> The design is usually surmounted by the winged
disc representing the sun, and the whole is not improbably
meant to symbolise the mystery of procreation, in
which the male element enshrined in the sun, and the
female element inhabiting the tree are appropriately
represented. The same collocation is met with on an
altar from the Palmyrene now in Rome, on one of
the faces of which is the image of a solar god, and on
the other the figure of a cypress with a child carrying
a ram amidst its foliage.<a class="fn" id="fr_197" href="#fn_197">[197]</a> In this connection it may
be remembered that Apuleius, wishing to paint the
son of Venus in his mother&rsquo;s lap, is related to have
depicted him in the midst of a cypress-tree.</p>

<p>The above facts are important for their bearing on
the conception of a tree-inhabiting spirit of vegetation
or generalised tree-soul, which, as Mannhardt and
Frazer have shown, lies at the root of many otherwise
inexplicable observances found amongst the peasantry
in different countries and at different periods of
history. These customs will be dealt with more
fully in a subsequent chapter. In all of them we find
a tree, or the branch of a tree, or a human being or
puppet dressed to represent a tree, figuring as the
symbol or representative of a spirit who is regarded
as more or less friendly to man, and endowed with
the power of assisting his material prosperity. In
more primitive times than the present this prosperity
resolved itself into a question of fecundity, and the
power which could make the fields to bear, the flocks
to multiply, and women to give increase, naturally held
the foremost place in the affections of the people.
The rich and the cultured found other attributes to
worship and other gods to personify them, but the
peasant clung to the observances by which the spirit
of fertility was propitiated. Hence the tree, long
after it had ceased to be worshipped as the home of
the great gods, or to be regarded as the parent of
mankind, still held a firm place in the devotions of the
people as the embodiment of the all-powerful patron
of universal fertility.</p>
<p>Of the innumerable observances founded on this
idea the following may be taken as a sample. The
sacred chili or cedar of Gilgit, on the north-western
frontier of India, was held to have the power of
causing the herds to multiply and women to bear
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
children. At the commencement of wheat-sowing
three chosen unmarried youths, who had undergone
purification for three days, started for the mountains
where the cedars grew, taking with them wine, oil, and
bread, and fruit of every kind. Having found a
suitable tree they sprinkled the oil and wine on it,
while they ate the bread and fruit as a sacrificial feast.
Then they cut off a branch and brought it to the
village, where amid general rejoicing it was placed on
a large stone beside running water. A goat was then
sacrificed and its blood poured over the cedar branch,
while the villagers danced around it. The goat&rsquo;s
flesh was eaten, and every man went to his house
bearing a spray of cedar. On his arrival he said to
his wife, &ldquo;If you want children I have brought them
to you; if you want cattle I have brought them;
whatever you want, I have it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_198" href="#fn_198">[198]</a></p>
<p>The same idea is no doubt to be traced in the
form of survival, in the custom of giving a branch of
laurel to a bride which is found, according to Mannhardt,
at Carnac in Brittany;<a class="fn" id="fr_199" href="#fn_199">[199]</a> in the introduction of a
decorated pine-bough into the house of the bride, met
with in Little Russia, as well as in the ceremony of
&ldquo;carrying the May,&rdquo; adorned with lights, before the
bride and bridegroom in Hanoverian weddings.<a class="fn" id="fr_200" href="#fn_200">[200]</a></p>
<p>The day of these observances is past, but underlying
them there was a vital and still valid truth.
To us as to the ancients the tree is still the patron
of fertility, as those have discovered to their cost who
have bared a country of its forests. To us as to them
it is still the thing of all things living that is endowed
with the most enduring life, the most persistent vigour.
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
Generations come and go, but the tree lives on and
every spring puts forth new leaves, and every autumn
bears new seed, and even to its last decrepitude the
leaves are as green and the seeds as full of life as in
the prime of its youth. What changes has not the
oldest tree in England witnessed! In the southern
counties there is an ancient way, once thronged by
travellers, but now deserted and broken in its
continuity; yet to this day, even where parks and
pastures have overlain it, its course may still be
traced by the yew-trees planted at its side by pilgrims
journeying to the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury,
in the days when their brothers were fighting for the
White Rose or the Red.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">THE TREE AS ORACLE</span></h2>
<p>Amongst the innumerable sources from which the
nations of antiquity professed to derive knowledge of
futurity and practical guidance in the affairs of life the
tree held a very prominent place. Tree-oracles formed,
indeed, the natural corollary of tree-worship, and their
number and popularity provide additional testimony
to the genuineness and extent of the ancient belief that
certain trees were tenanted by a supernatural essence.
For it was as &ldquo;animated demoniac beings,&rdquo; to use
Robertson Smith&rsquo;s phrase, that trees possessed oracular
virtue. It was the god dwelling in them who produced
the mysterious rustlings and movements of the
branches, from which the responses were interpreted
by the attendant priests. But according to the ancient
view the tree derived a further title to its oracular
prestige from its connection by means of its roots
with the under-world, the mysterious abode of departed
spirits, in whom wisdom and knowledge of the future
were supposed to be vested. Thus the special
prophetic power attributed to the variety of oak
(probably the <i>Quercus esculus</i>) which grew at Dodona
was ascribed by later writers to the fact that its roots
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
pierced the earth more deeply than those of other
trees, reaching down even to Tartarus (<i>tantum radice
in Tartara</i>).<a class="fn" id="fr_201" href="#fn_201">[201]</a> It was from this under-world that Saul
summoned Samuel, and it was in the hope of obtaining
help from the spirit of some dead hero by means of a
dream, that men were wont to pass the night at his
tomb or his temple. The modern Arabs who still
worship certain sacred trees, as the place where angels
or <i>jinni</i> descend, believe that a sick man who sleeps
under such a tree will receive counsel in a dream for
the restoration of his health.<a class="fn" id="fr_202" href="#fn_202">[202]</a></p>
<p>Of organised oracles the earliest was no doubt the
earth oracle, and the part played in the ceremonial
by natural fissures, springs, and trees probably grew
out of their close connection with the earth. The
most famous oracle of antiquity, that of Delphi, was
situated at the opening of a natural cleft in the rock,
believed to be at the very centre of the earth, and was
originally presided over by the great earth-mother,
Gaia, the subordinate part played by the laurel which
once grew near the cleft being expressed by the legend
that Daphne was the daughter and priestess of Gaia.<a class="fn" id="fr_203" href="#fn_203">[203]</a>
The procedure at another famous oracle, that of
Trophonius at Lebadea, near Mount Helicon in
Boeotia, was distinctly modelled on the idea of a
descent into the under-world,<a class="fn" id="fr_204" href="#fn_204">[204]</a> the suppliant obtaining
his answer in a cave, where his experiences were so
terrible that he never smiled again; whence it came
to be said of any particularly lugubrious individual
that he had consulted the oracle of Trophonius. A
still more striking illustration of the antiquity of this
conception is found in the account of the initiation of
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
an augur given on a Babylonian tablet in the British
Museum. The candidate is there made to descend
into an artificial imitation of the lower world, where he
beholds &ldquo;the altars amidst the waters, the treasures
of Anu, Bel, and Ea, the tablets of the gods, the
delivering of the oracle of heaven and earth, and the
cedar-tree, the beloved of the great gods.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_205" href="#fn_205">[205]</a> Here the
earth-oracle and the tree-oracle are seen in very early
conjunction; but the belief in the divine power inherent
in the tree can be traced still farther back, for in a
bilingual text of much earlier date we read of &ldquo;the
cedar-tree, the tree that shatters the power of the
incubus, upon whose core is recorded the name of Ea,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> the god of wisdom.<a class="fn" id="fr_206" href="#fn_206">[206]</a></p>
<p>The idea of the tree-oracle was familiar to other
branches of the Semitic race, and is expressed in their
common tradition of a tree of knowledge. Several
allusions to oracular trees are met with in the Old
Testament. That Jehovah should speak to Moses
out of the burning-bush, if not to be regarded as a
case in point, was at any rate quite in conformity
with surrounding tradition, for there is no doubt that
the belief in trees as places of divine revelation was
very prevalent in Canaan. The famous holy tree near
Shechem, called the tree of the soothsayers in Judges
ix. 37, and the tree or trees of the revealer in Genesis
xii. 6 and Deuteronomy xi. 30, must have been the
seat of a Canaanite tree-oracle.<a class="fn" id="fr_207" href="#fn_207">[207]</a> The prophetess
Deborah gave her responses under a palm near
Bethel, which, according to sacred tradition, marked
the grave of the nurse of Rachel. And David, when
he inquired of the Lord as to the right moment for
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
attacking the Philistines, received the signal in &ldquo;the
sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry-trees.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_208" href="#fn_208">[208]</a>
The <i>ash&ecirc;ra</i> or artificial tree in which the deity was
supposed to dwell also appears to have been used by
the Canaanites for the purposes of divination, a practice
probably alluded to in the rebuke of the prophet,
&ldquo;My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff
declareth unto them.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_209" href="#fn_209">[209]</a></p>
<p>But by far the most striking instance of a tree-oracle,
and perhaps one may even say the most signal
vestige of the primitive tree-worship, was the oracle of
the Pelasgic Zeus at Dodona in Epirus. Here in a
grove of oaks there was a very ancient tree, believed
to be the actual seat of the deity, whose responses
were interpreted from the rustling of its branches, from
the murmur of the sacred spring which welled forth at
its foot, or from the drawing of the oracle lots kept in
an urn beneath it. The origin of the oracle is lost in
prehistoric gloom; probably it existed earlier than the
worship of Zeus himself. Homer makes Ulysses
visit it,<a class="fn" id="fr_210" href="#fn_210">[210]</a> and Hesiod states that Zeus dwelt there in the
trunk of a tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_211" href="#fn_211">[211]</a> Herodotus affirms, on the testimony
both of the priestesses of Dodona and of the Egyptian
priests at Thebes, that the oracle was introduced
from Egypt, and adds that the manner in which
oracles were delivered at Thebes and at Dodona was
very similar. The priests at Thebes told him that
two women employed in their temple had been
captured by Phoenicians, and sold the one into Libya,
the other to the Greeks; the former established the
oracle of Zeus Ammon in the Libyan desert, the latter
that of Dodona. In the account given him by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
Dodonaean priestesses, it was asserted that the oracles
were founded by two black pigeons from Thebes.<a class="fn" id="fr_212" href="#fn_212">[212]</a>
We know from other sources that the oracle of Zeus-Ammon
was vested in an ancient tree (<span title="gerandryon" class="g">&gamma;&epsilon;&rho;&#8049;&nu;&delta;&rho;&upsilon;&omicron;&nu;</span>).<a class="fn" id="fr_213" href="#fn_213">[213]</a>
But whatever may have been its origin there is no
doubt that the oracle of Dodona had a long and active
career, continuing for close upon two thousand years.
Silius Italicus, towards the end of the first century <span class="small">A.D.</span>,
reiterates the statement of Hesiod that the deity at
Dodona occupied a tree;<a class="fn" id="fr_214" href="#fn_214">[214]</a> Pausanias a hundred years
later found the tree still green and flourishing,<a class="fn" id="fr_215" href="#fn_215">[215]</a> and
Philostratos about the same time saw it adorned with
wreaths and sacred fillets, &ldquo;because, like the Delphic
tripod, it gave forth oracles.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_216" href="#fn_216">[216]</a> A later writer states
that the oracular voices ceased on the felling of the
tree by a certain Illyrian bandit,<a class="fn" id="fr_217" href="#fn_217">[217]</a> but there is evidence
that the tree and the oracle were still in existence in
the middle of the fourth century <span class="small">A.D.</span> These ancient
testimonies to the importance of the oracle have been
marvellously corroborated by the discovery in the
course of recent excavations of a large number of
leaden tablets inscribed with the questions addressed
to the god by his votaries, and dating from 400 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
onwards.<a class="fn" id="fr_218" href="#fn_218">[218]</a></p>
<p>According to classical mythology, the oracular
virtue of the famous oak of Dodona was not only
transmitted to its offshoots, but even preserved in the
dead wood after its separation from the tree. Ovid,
in relating the story of the plague of Aegina, tells how
Aeacus, standing beneath</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A branching oak, the Sire&rsquo;s own tree, from seed</p>
<p class="t0">Of old Dodona sprung,</p>
</div>
<p>calls upon Zeus to repeople his stricken kingdom, and
fill his desolate walls anew with citizens as numerous
as the ants at his feet.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t13">Not a breath</p>
<p class="t0">Was stirring, but the branches shook, the leaves</p>
<p class="t0">With rustling murmur waved.</p>
</div>
<p>Accepting the omen he kisses the sacred tree, falls
asleep beneath it, and wakes to find that the ants have
been miraculously changed into men, the famous
Myrmidons.<a class="fn" id="fr_219" href="#fn_219">[219]</a> Again, it is related by more than one
author that when the good ship <i>Argo</i> was built,
Athena introduced into it by way of amulet a beam
hewn in the grove of Dodona, which in the subsequent
voyage constantly gave the Argonauts warning and
advice.<a class="fn" id="fr_220" href="#fn_220">[220]</a></p>
<p>At the famous oracle of Delphi the tree played as
intrinsic, if not so predominant, a part as at Dodona,
its function being shared by the fissure in the earth
and the sacred spring, which testify to the chthonic
origin of the oracle, whilst the use of the sacred tripod
has been thought to connect it with the class of fire
oracles.<a class="fn" id="fr_221" href="#fn_221">[221]</a> There is evidence that a laurel-tree grew
beside the oracular fissure in Gaia&rsquo;s time,<a class="fn" id="fr_222" href="#fn_222">[222]</a> and, according
to tradition, the earliest temple of Apollo was a
hut of laurel boughs erected by the god&rsquo;s own hands.<a class="fn" id="fr_223" href="#fn_223">[223]</a>
And later on, when the original tree had disappeared
and the fissure had been enclosed in the Adytum, the
entrance to the latter, as well as the tripod on which
the Pythia sat, were hidden in fresh laurel leaves
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
whenever the oracle was given, and the priestess
having chewed laurel leaves and crowned herself with
a wreath of the sacred plant, waved a laurel branch
while chanting her ecstatic utterances. Every ninth
year, moreover, a bower of laurel branches was erected
in the forecourt of the temple. It is uncertain how
far Apollo&rsquo;s close connection with the laurel may have
originated from Delphi, but it is a fact that in
later times his oracular function was inseparably
bound up with the use of that tree, and the laurel
became the recognised instrument of prophecy (<i>per
lauros geomantis</i>). And at Delphi, when the laurel
trees had disappeared, the oracle ceased, for the
messenger sent by the Emperor Julian to reinaugurate
it received for answer, &ldquo;Tell the king that the
cunningly-built chamber has fallen to the ground;
Apollo no longer has bower, or inspired laurel, or
prophetic spring; vanished is the talking water.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_224" href="#fn_224">[224]</a></p>
<p>To pass briefly over other examples of tree-oracle,
in Armenia the fire-priests were wont to interpret the
will of the god from the movements observed in the
branches of the holy plane-tree at Armavira.<a class="fn" id="fr_225" href="#fn_225">[225]</a> The
Chaldaeo-Assyrians read the future in the rustling of
the leaves of the prophetic trees.<a class="fn" id="fr_226" href="#fn_226">[226]</a> At Nejr&acirc;n, in
Yemen, the Arabs professed to obtain oracles from the
spirit who inhabited a sacred date-palm.<a class="fn" id="fr_227" href="#fn_227">[227]</a></p>
<p>In the Sh&aacute;h N&aacute;meh, Firdausi, working no doubt
upon an ancient tradition, tells how Sikander, or
Alexander the Great, consulted a tree-oracle in
Persia.<a class="fn" id="fr_228" href="#fn_228">[228]</a> &ldquo;From thence he proceeded to another city,
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
where he was received with great homage by the most
illustrious of the nation. He inquired of them if
there were anything wonderful or extraordinary in
their country, that he might go to see it, and they
replied that there were two trees in the kingdom, one
a male, the other a female, from which a voice
proceeded. The male tree spoke in the day and the
female tree in the night, and whoever had a wish went
thither to have his desires accomplished. Sikander
immediately repaired to the spot, and approaching it,
he hoped in his heart that a considerable part of his
life still remained to be enjoyed. When he came
under the tree a terrible sound arose and rang in his
ears, and he asked the people present what it meant.
The attendant priest said it implied that fourteen
years of his life still remained. Sikander at this
interpretation of the prophetic sound wept, and the
burning tears ran down his cheeks. Again he asked,
&lsquo;Shall I return to R&uacute;m and see my mother and
children before I die?&rsquo; and the answer was, &lsquo;Thou
wilt die at Kash&aacute;n.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amongst the Romans other forms of augury
appear to have taken the place of the old tree-oracles
and reduced them to comparative insignificance. The
most important of those that remained was the
prophetic ilex grove upon the Aventine hill, sacred to
Faunus and Picus. Hither the applicant came, fasting
and meanly clothed, and having crowned himself with
beech leaves, sacrificed two sheep to the deities of the
grove, and laying himself down upon their pelts,
awaited the counsel of the gods in his dream.<a class="fn" id="fr_229" href="#fn_229">[229]</a> There
was another grove oracle of Faunus at Tibur by the
Albunean spring,<a class="fn" id="fr_230" href="#fn_230">[230]</a> and at the neighbouring Preneste,
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
where the oracle of Jupiter was held in great repute,
the oracle lots were fashioned from the wood of his
sacred oak.<a class="fn" id="fr_231" href="#fn_231">[231]</a> At the more sequestered Tiora Matiena
the tree-oracle appears to have dwindled into a mere
vestige, the responses being given by a woodpecker
perched upon an oaken column.<a class="fn" id="fr_232" href="#fn_232">[232]</a></p>
<p>To tree-omens, as distinguished from tree-oracles,
the Romans attached much importance, and they
possessed several treatises dealing with such portents.
The family and community tree described in the last
chapter had a certain oracular character, and foretold in
its own fortunes the prosperity or adversity of those
whom it represented. The withering of the laurel
grove of Augustus was held to portend the death of
Nero, and with him the extinction of the Augustan
house and its adopted members; the fall of Vespasian&rsquo;s
cypress foretold the death of Domitian. If the sacred
tree attached to a sanctuary were uprooted by the
wind, it was a clear proof that the deity had withdrawn
his protection, and unless the tree upreared itself anew,
his worship at that spot was discontinued. The
Sibylline books contained explicit instructions with
regard to these eventualities and were invariably
consulted in every such case. Innumerable instances
of these tree-omens are given in classical literature.<a class="fn" id="fr_233" href="#fn_233">[233]</a></p>
<p>The legends of trees which spoke intelligibly
belong rather to myth than to history, but they were
quite in accordance with the ancient belief that any
tree which contained a tree-soul, were it the spirit of
a god or only that of a dryad, might express itself in
words. Thus the spirits inhabiting the three trees
of the Hesperides gave advice to the wandering
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
Argonauts. Philostratus relates that at the command
of Apollonius a tree addressed him in a distinct female
voice.<a class="fn" id="fr_234" href="#fn_234">[234]</a> When Rome was invaded by the Gauls a
voice from out of the grove of Vesta warned the
Romans to repair their walls or their city would fall.<a class="fn" id="fr_235" href="#fn_235">[235]</a>
And after the battle in which Brutus and Aruns
Tarquinius slew each other, a powerful voice from the
neighbouring grove of Arsia announced that the
victory lay with the Romans.<a class="fn" id="fr_236" href="#fn_236">[236]</a> A later instance is
that of the <i>gharcad</i> tree which spoke to Moslim
b. &lsquo;Ocba in a dream, and designated him to the command
of the army of Yaz&#299;d against Medina.<a class="fn" id="fr_237" href="#fn_237">[237]</a></p>
<p>It has already been mentioned that the responses
at Dodona were sometimes interpreted from the oracle
lots kept in an urn that stood upon a sacred table
beneath the tree, and the same form of divination
was also apparently in use at Delphi,<a class="fn" id="fr_238" href="#fn_238">[238]</a> whilst at
Preneste it was the sole method employed. Indeed
this outgrowth of the tree-oracle was in common use
throughout the ancient world. There is a probable
allusion to it in Ezekiel xxi. 21. The Scythian
soothsayers were wont to divine by the help of a
number of willow rods, which they placed upon the
ground, uttering their predictions as they gathered
them up one by one. They also practised divination
by means of the bark of the linden-tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_239" href="#fn_239">[239]</a> Amongst
the neighbouring Alani, in Sarmatia, women foretold
the future by means of straight rods cut with secret
enchantments at certain times and marked very
carefully.<a class="fn" id="fr_240" href="#fn_240">[240]</a> The Germans used to divine by means of
the fragments of a branch cut from a fruit-tree, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
they threw on to a white cloth.<a class="fn" id="fr_241" href="#fn_241">[241]</a> The omen sticks of
the Druids, frequently referred to in the Bardic poems,
were probably rods cut from a fruit-tree and marked
with mystical emblems.<a class="fn" id="fr_242" href="#fn_242">[242]</a></p>
<p>It is not easy to define the exact connection
between these oracle-lots and that strange survival,
the divining-rod, but it may be taken for certain that
the belief in the efficacy of the latter is &ldquo;a superstition
cognate to the belief in sacred trees,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_243" href="#fn_243">[243]</a> and that the
idea underlying both the oracle-lot and the divining-rod
was that they were animated by an indwelling
spirit, probably by the spirit of the tree from which
they were cut. We know from Pliny and Pausanias
that the earliest images of the gods were made of
wood, and that the Greeks, Romans, and other pre-Christian
nations worshipped stakes or peeled rods
of wood, painted, or dressed, or roughly carved in
the semblance of an anthropomorphic god, and supposed
to be inhabited by a divine essence. It was
probably by a similar mode of reasoning that the
spear, the sceptre, the staff of the general, the
standards of the army, the herald&rsquo;s wand, the rods
of the flamens, the lituus of the augur, and the
truncheon of the constable came to be symbolically
representative of power and inviolability, the primitive
assumption being that they retained some of the
divine spirit resident in the tree from which they
were cut.<a class="fn" id="fr_244" href="#fn_244">[244]</a> From a similar parentage sprang the
popular custom of striking men, cattle, and plants
with a green switch (Lebensrute) at certain seasons
of the year in order to make them fruitful, an
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
observance of which so many instances have been
collected by Mannhardt. &ldquo;It was the tree-soul, the
spirit of vegetation,&rdquo; he concludes, &ldquo;communicated by
means of this switching, which drove away the demons
of sickness and sterility and evoked fruitfulness and
health.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_245" href="#fn_245">[245]</a> The divining-rod is, if one may say so,
first cousin to the &ldquo;life-rood.&rdquo; Each represents and
embodies a different function of the supernatural&mdash;the
one its procreative, the other its prophetic attribute.
The divining-rod is the meagre survival of the once
renowned tree-oracle.</p>
<p>It may seem strange that in this positive age there
should exist people calling themselves educated, who
believe that a stick cut from a hazel or thorn-bush
may in the hands of a specially endowed person
possess a magical power of revealing the secrets of
the earth. But so it is. There are in this country
at the present hour some half-dozen professional
experts, who claim the faculty of discovering unsuspected
springs of water by means of the divining-rod,
and furnish well-attested instances of their success.
It is not necessary to discuss the credibility of their
assertions or to formulate a theory to account for their
success. The subject of the divining-rod concerns us
only in so far as it is a vestige&mdash;a poor and atrophied
vestige&mdash;of the magic eloquence once associated with
the sacred tree. It is impossible to say when the use
of the divining-rod first originated. It is mentioned
in the Vedas, and is well known to have flourished
amongst the Chaldaeans and Egyptians. But in those
early days the function of the magical rod was not
restricted, as it was later and is now, to the search
for water or buried treasure. The Greeks and Romans
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
found many uses for it. Cicero speaks of providing
for one&rsquo;s wants, <i>quasi virgul&acirc; divin&acirc;, ut aiunt</i>. It
was a familiar instrument in the hands of the British
Druids, and is still largely employed in China.
Mediaeval writers speak of it as being in very
common use among the miners of Germany.<a class="fn" id="fr_246" href="#fn_246">[246]</a></p>
<p>At all times and in all places the act of cutting
and preparing the rod has been the subject of much
ceremony. It had to be severed at a particular
moment, and from a particular kind of tree, the latter
varying according to the country. As a rule a
fruit-tree, or some other tree that was useful and
beneficent to man, was chosen. The Chinese prefer
the peach; the Druids made choice of the apple-tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_247" href="#fn_247">[247]</a>
Elsewhere the hazel, the willow, and the black-thorn
have been selected, and the last-named is still
known in Germany as the &ldquo;wishing-thorn,&rdquo; as it is
the tree from which wishing-rods were cut. The time
at which the rod was cut was equally important. For
centuries the Chinese have adhered to the first new
moon after the winter solstice as the most favourable
date for the ceremony. The French custom was to
cut it on Mercury&rsquo;s day (Wednesday) at the planetary
hour of Mercury.<a class="fn" id="fr_248" href="#fn_248">[248]</a> In Sweden divining-rods of mistletoe
are cut on midsummer eve.<a class="fn" id="fr_249" href="#fn_249">[249]</a> Even in comparatively
modern times believers in the divining-rod professed
to expect more of a rod which had been cut between
sunset and sunrise, upon some holy day or at new
moon, from a branch on which the rising sun first shone.<a class="fn" id="fr_250" href="#fn_250">[250]</a></p>
<p>These mystic observances smack of a far-distant
past, and the modern water-finder appears to have
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
discarded them. His practice is to cut a forked
branch about eighteen inches in length from any
convenient hazel or white-thorn bush, and grasping
the prongs very firmly between the thumb and two
first fingers of each hand, the joint being held downwards,
he walks over the ground where it is desired
to find water. If he approaches a hidden spring, the
joint will begin to rise against his will, and when he
has reached it, will make a complete half revolution,
breaking or bending the twigs held in his hands, until
the joint is uppermost. The depth of the spring is
estimated by the force with which the rod is repelled
from it. The mental exhaustion of the operator after
a successful operation is said to be considerable. In
an old volume of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (No. 44) an
account is given of a certain Lady Noel who was
skilful in the use of the divining-rod. She used a
thin forked hazel-twig, which immediately bent when
she came over the underground spring, its motion being
more or less rapid as she approached or withdrew from
the spot. &ldquo;When just over it the twig turned so quick
as to snap, breaking near the fingers, which by pressing
it were indented and heated and almost blistered.
A degree of agitation was also visible in her face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the superstitious practices that still survive
in remote villages are no doubt of the same
ancestry as the divining-rod. In the valley of Lanzo
in Piedmont, lovers in doubt whether to marry consult
the oracle in the form of a herb called <i>concordia</i>, the
root of which is shaped like two hands, each with its
five fingers. If the herb they find has the hands conjoined,
the omen is favourable; but unfavourable if
the hands point different ways.<a class="fn" id="fr_251" href="#fn_251">[251]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>The following na&iuml;ve recital is quoted in Brand&rsquo;s
antiquities:&mdash;&ldquo;Last Friday was Valentine&rsquo;s day, and
the night before I got five bay-leaves, and pinned four
of them to the four corners of my pillow, and the fifth
to the middle; and then, if I dreamt of my sweetheart,
Betty said we should be married before the year was
out.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_252" href="#fn_252">[252]</a> This belief in the magical power of certain
leaves is enshrined in many jingles, still found in the
rustic formulary, such as&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The even ash-leaf in my glove</p>
<p class="t0">The first I meet shall be my love;<a class="fn" id="fr_253" href="#fn_253">[253]</a></p>
</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Find even ash or four-leaved clover</p>
<p class="t0">And you&rsquo;ll see your true love before the day&rsquo;s over.<a class="fn" id="fr_254" href="#fn_254">[254]</a></p>
</div>
<p>In old days on St. Valentine&rsquo;s eve many a rustic
maid has sprinkled bay-leaves with rose-water and
laid them across her pillow, and then lying down in a
clean night-gown, turned wrong side out, has softly
recited&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Good Valentine, be kind to me,</p>
<p class="t0">In dreams let me my true love see;<a class="fn" id="fr_255" href="#fn_255">[255]</a></p>
</div>
<p>or, if she were a Staffordshire lass, she probably
preferred St. Thomas&rsquo;s eve, and having placed a
sprig of evergreen under her pillow, sighed&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Good St. Thomas, stand by my bed</p>
<p class="t0">And tell me when I shall be wed.<a class="fn" id="fr_256" href="#fn_256">[256]</a></p>

<p>To those who are new to the subject of comparative
mythology these doggrels whispered by foolish country

girls under the stress of a natural impulse may seem
absurdly irrelevant. But to that science which strives
to unravel the beliefs and ideas of long dead people,
every vestige, every survival is important. The
charms above mentioned did not spring, fully matured,
from the brain of some peculiarly inventive dairy-maid.
They have a long, long pedigree, and, like the
zebra stripe which will sometimes appear on a purebred
horse, they throw us back to an age when man
believed that the world was controlled by spirits, and
that he, like everything else, was but a puppet in
their hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">THE UNIVERSE-TREE</span></h2>
<p>One of the most interesting points in connection with
tree myths is the wide distribution of the conception
of the cosmogonic or world-tree, of which the
Scandinavian Yggdrasil is the most familiar example.
The idea is met with amongst the ancient Chaldaeans,
the Egyptians, the Persians, the Hindus, and the
Aryan races of Northern Europe, as well as in the
mythology of China and Japan; and this community of
tradition has been regarded by some authorities as
pointing to a prehistoric intercourse between these
widely-separated races, if not to their common origin.<a class="fn" id="fr_257" href="#fn_257">[257]</a>
But, apart from the fact that the same conception
is also found in a rudimentary form amongst the
aborigines of New Zealand and America, it is not
difficult to imagine that it may have occurred separately
to more than one inquirer. In short, &ldquo;the idea of
referring to the form of a tree the apparent conformation
of the universe is one of the most natural methods
of reasoning which can occur to the savage mind.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_258" href="#fn_258">[258]</a>
The moment he began to concern himself with such
questions, the primitive thinker must have asked himself
why the heavenly firmament, with its sun and stars
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
and the waters above it, did not fall to earth like
everything else within his knowledge. His mind
naturally demanded some prop or support to antagonise
what in his experience was the unrestricted despotism of
geocentric gravitation. The Egyptian explained the
problem by representing the sky as the star-spangled
body of the goddess Nu&#788;&icirc;t, who had been separated
from her husband Sib&ucirc;, the earth, by the efforts of
Sh&ucirc;. In the mythology of the Maoris, Rangi, the
sky, was forcibly separated from his wife, the universal
mother, earth, by one of their children, Tane Mahuta,
father of forests, who planting his head upon the earth,
upheld the heavens with his feet.<a class="fn" id="fr_259" href="#fn_259">[259]</a></p>
<p>The fact that the celestial bodies were observed to
revolve around a fixed point rendered it a necessity
that this assumed support of the heaven should be
of the nature of a central axis, upholding the sky-roof
as the pole upholds a tent. To the inhabitants of
mountainous countries, who saw the clouds resting
upon the peaks, the idea of a heaven-supporting
mountain no doubt presented itself as the most reasonable
solution. Thus Aristotle, to quote Lord Bacon,
&ldquo;elegantly expoundeth the ancient fable of Atlas (that
stood fixed and bare up the heaven from falling) to be
meant of the poles or axle-tree of heaven.&rdquo; To plain-dwellers,
however, the tree was the loftiest object
within their experience, and it may be conjectured that
the idea of a central world-supporting tree was a product
of the lowlands. In some cases the two conceptions
were combined and the world-tree was placed
on the summit of a world-mountain. It is interesting,
however, to note that the earliest known version of a
world-tree, pure and simple, comes to us from the fertile
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
alluvial plain on the borders of the Persian Gulf. The
account, contained in an old bilingual hymn, and probably
of Accadian origin, represents the tree as growing
in the garden of Edin or Eden, placed by Babylonian
tradition in the immediate vicinity of Eridu, a city
which flourished at the mouth of the Euphrates
between 3000 and 4000 <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In Eridu a stalk grew overshadowing; in a holy place did it become green;</p>
<p class="t0">Its roots were of white crystal, which stretched towards the deep.</p>
<p class="t0">(Before) Ea was its course in Eridu, teeming with fertility;</p>
<p class="t0">Its seat was the (central place of the earth);</p>
<p class="t0">Its foliage (?) was the couch of Zikum the (primaeval) mother.</p>
<p class="t0">Into the heart of its holy house, which spread its shade like a forest, hath no man entered.</p>
<p class="t0">(There is the home) of the mighty mother who passes across the sky.</p>
<p class="t0">In the midst of it was Tammuz.</p>
<p class="t0">There is the shrine of the two (gods).<a class="fn" id="fr_260" href="#fn_260">[260]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Of this glorified tree or stem it is to be observed
that it grew at the centre of the earth; that its roots
pierced down into the abysmal watery deep, where the
amphibious Ea, the god of wisdom, had his seat, and
whence he nourished the earth with springs and
streams; that its foliage supported Zikum, the primordial
heavens, and overshadowed the earth, which
was apparently regarded as a plane placed midway
between the firmament above and the deep below.
The stem itself was the home of Davkina, consort of
Ea, the great mother, &ldquo;the lady of the Earth,&rdquo; and of
her son Tammuz, a temple too sacred for mortals to
enter.</p>
<p>Even were it not to be inferred from other evidence,
there could be little doubt that the people amongst
whom the above conception arose must have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
already familiar with tree-worship. The mighty stem,
in which the great gods dwelt, was but a poetical
amplification of the sacred, spirit-inhabited tree, and
arose out of the same idealising process as that which
gave birth to the nearly related tree of knowledge
and tree of life.</p>
<p>Side by side with that of a world-tree the conception
of a world-mountain is also met with in the primitive
cosmogony of the Chaldaeans, but while the former
tradition belonged to Sumir or Southern Babylonia,
the latter seems to have prevailed in the Northern
Accad, whose inhabitants had once been mountain-dwellers.<a class="fn" id="fr_261" href="#fn_261">[261]</a>
This &ldquo;mountain of the world,&rdquo; &ldquo;whose
head rivalled the heaven,&rdquo; which had the pure deep for
its foundation and was the home of the gods, was
placed in the north, and its worship survived in that
of the &ldquo;illustrious mounds&rdquo; of the Babylonian plain,
which were equally regarded as the visible habitation
of divine spirits. Isaiah represents the king of
Babylon as boasting, &ldquo;I will ascend into heaven, I
will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I
will sit upon the mount of congregation, in the uttermost
parts of the north.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_262" href="#fn_262">[262]</a> It seems clear that the
prophet is alluding to the myth of a Chaldaean Olympus,
where the gods held their assemblies. In one of the
Babylonian hymns this mountain is addressed as, &ldquo;O
thou who givest shade, Lord who castest thy shadow
over the land, great mount,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_263" href="#fn_263">[263]</a> from which it might
appear that the idea of the world-mountain was not
very strictly dissociated from that of a world-tree.</p>
<p>In the corresponding cosmogony, which was current
five thousand years later amongst the Scandinavians,
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
the two conceptions were unequivocally combined.
The Norse Yggdrasil, in spite of the many quaint
symbolical fancies which have been embroidered on to
the main conception, represents such a remarkable
amalgamation of ideas originally Oriental that it is
difficult to believe that it can have had a totally
independent origin. The world-mountain, the world-tree
with the birds in its branches, and the connection
of the latter with another peculiarly Eastern idea, that
of the food of the gods, are all reproduced in the
cosmogonic traditions of the Eddas, and it is highly
probable that they formed part of a primitive folk-lore
common to the different races. As their culture grew
the Chaldaeans gave up their earlier conception, and
came to regard the earth as a gigantic bowl floating
bottom upwards upon the deep, but to the Norse poet
the world still remained a flat disc surrounded by a river
ocean, and limited by mountain ranges. In its centre
Asgard, the mountain of the gods, was pierced by a
mighty tree trunk, the branches of which overshadowed
the world and supported the sky, the stars, and the
clouds, whilst its roots stretched downwards into the
primordial abyss. The apples stored in Valhal, by
eating which the gods preserved their youth, closely
correspond to the amrita or soma which, as we shall
see, was a peculiar feature of the Eastern conception of
the world-tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief and most holy seat of the gods,&rdquo; say
the Eddas, &ldquo;is by the ash Yggdrasil. There the
gods meet in council every day. It is the greatest
and best of all trees, its branches spread over all the
world and reach above heaven. Three roots sustain
the tree and stand wide apart: one is with the Asa;
the second with the Frost-giants; the third reaches
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
into Niflheim, and under it is Hvergelmer, where
Nidhug gnaws the root from below. But under the
second root, which extends to the Frost-giants, is the
well of Mimer, wherein knowledge and wisdom are
concealed. The third root of the ash is in heaven,
and beneath it is the most sacred fountain of Urd.
Here the gods have their doomstead. The Asa ride
thither every day over Bifrost, which is also called
Asa-bridge. There stands a beautiful hall near the
fountain beneath the ash. Out of it come three maids.
These maids shape the lives of men and we call them
the Norns. On the boughs of the ash sits an eagle,
who knows many things. Between his eyes sits the
hawk, called Vedfolner. A squirrel, by name Ratat&ouml;sk,
springs up and down the tree and bears words of hate
between the eagle and Nidhug. Four stags leap
about in the branches of the ash and bite the buds.
The Norns that dwell by the fountain of Urd every
day take water from the fountain, and clay that lies
around the fountain, and sprinkle therewith the ash, in
order that its branches may not wither or decay....
In Valhal there is a chest, kept by Ithun, in which are
the apples that the gods must bite when they grow old,
in order to become young again.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_264" href="#fn_264">[264]</a></p>
<p>In the above description the various denizens of
the tree have been supposed to symbolise natural
phenomena. The stags who bite the buds are the
four cardinal winds; the eagle and the hawk represent
respectively the air and the wind-still ether; the
serpent Nidhug who gnaws the root in the subterranean
abyss symbolises volcanic forces, and the
squirrel, who runs up and down the tree, hail and
other atmospheric phenomena.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 27.</span>&mdash;Yggdrasil&mdash;the Scandinavian world-tree.<br />(From Finn Magnusen&rsquo;s <i>Eddalaeren</i>.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>A similar if somewhat less detailed symbolism is
met with in both the Indian and Persian traditions of
the world-tree, a symbolism which often obscures and
overshadows its cosmic function. In both countries
the mythical tree was venerated rather as a tree
of life, the source of the immortalising soma or
haoma, than as the supporter of the universe. The
latter function was not indeed quite lost sight of, for
the Kalpadruma of the Vedas was a cloud-tree of
colossal size, which grew on a steep mountain, and by
its shadow produced day and night before the creation
of the sun and moon; and in the Rig-Veda Brahma
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
himself is described as the vast over-spreading tree
of the universe, of which the gods are the branches.
Similarly in Persian legend, near the haoma-tree
stood the tree of all seeds, frequented by two birds,
one of which when he settled on it broke off a
thousand branches and caused their seeds to fall,
while the other carried them to a place whence they
might be conveyed to the earth with the rain. The
same idea, even to the two birds, recurs in the
Indian traditions of the mystical soma-tree, which,
besides producing the immortalising drink, also bore
fruit and seed of every kind. It was from this tree
that the immortals shaped the heaven and the earth:
it grew in the third heaven, overshadowing it with its
branches. Beneath it sat the gods, quaffing the precious
soma, whereby they preserved their immortality.</p>
<p>Amongst the followers of Buddha this tradition
of a supernatural tree underwent a further process of
idealisation. Their fancy described it as covered with
divine flowers, and gleaming with every kind of precious
stone. To its smallest leaf it was formed of
gems. It grew on a pure and level sward, resplendent
in colour as the peacock&rsquo;s neck. It received the
homage of the gods.<a class="fn" id="fr_265" href="#fn_265">[265]</a> It was beneath this tree that
Gautama took his seat, resolved not to stir until he
had attained to perfect knowledge. The tempter
M&acirc;ra, with his hosts of demons, assailed him with
fiery darts, with rain in floods and hurricanes; but the
Buddha remained unmoved, until the defeated demons
fled away. This is probably a Buddhist rendering of
the Vedic account of the great fight between the
powers of light and darkness for the clouds and the
ambrosia they contained. Gautama also wins the
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
victory, but for him it is knowledge and enlightenment
that should constitute the true object of human desire.</p>
<p>Briefer references to the cosmic tree are met with
in the traditions of other races. According to the
Phoenicians the universe was framed on the model
of a tent, its axis a revolving cosmic tree, supporting
a blue canopy on which the heavenly bodies were embroidered.
The Egyptians, in one of their schemes
of the universe, also represented the central axis as
a colossal tree, on whose branches Bennu the sun god
perched. It gave forth celestial rain, which descended
on the fields of Lower Egypt, and penetrated to the
under-world to refresh those who are in Amenti. The
Osirian T&acirc;t-pillar, alluded to in a previous chapter, is
thought by Professor Tiele to be derived from the
conception of the world-pillar, though M. Maspero
regards its cosmic symbolism as a later accretion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a post on which is graven a human countenance,
and which is covered with gay clothing, stands
the so-called T&acirc;t-pillar, entirely made up of superimposed
capitals, one of which has a rude face
scratched upon it, intended no doubt to represent the
shining sun. On the top of the pillar is placed the
complete head-dress of Osiris, the ram&rsquo;s horns, the
sun, the ureus adder, the double feather, all emblems
of light and sovereignty, which in my judgment
must have been intended to represent the highest
heaven.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_266" href="#fn_266">[266]</a></p>
<p>The conception of the world-tree is also found
in the golden gem-bearing tree of the sky, where,
according to Egyptian mythology, Nu&#788;&icirc;t had her abode.
&ldquo;She is goddess of the heavenly ocean, whose body
is decked with stars. The pilgrim to the lower world
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
eats of the fruit, and the goddess leaning from the
tree pours out the water of life.&rdquo; This was in the west
on the way travelled by the dead. To the east there
was another tree, with wide radiating branches bearing
jewels, up which the strong morning sun, Horus,
climbed to the zenith of heaven. It has been
suggested that this &ldquo;Sycamore of Emerald&rdquo; was
a mythological rendering of the beautiful green tints
on the horizon at the rising and setting of the sun.<a class="fn" id="fr_267" href="#fn_267">[267]</a></p>
<p>The tradition of a universe-tree is found also in
China and Japan. The legends of the latter country
speak of an enormous metal pine which grows in
the north at the centre of the world.<a class="fn" id="fr_268" href="#fn_268">[268]</a> In Chinese
mythology seven miraculous trees once flourished on
the Kuen L&uuml;n Mountains. One of them, which was
of jade, bore fruit that conferred immortality; another,
named Tong, grew on the highest peak, &ldquo;hard by the
closed gate of heaven.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_269" href="#fn_269">[269]</a></p>
<p>It is interesting to find somewhat similar traditions
current in the New World. According to the cosmogony
of the Sia Indians&mdash;a small diminished tribe
inhabiting New Mexico&mdash;there was in each of the
six regions of the world, North, South, East, West,
Zenith, and Nadir, a mountain bearing a giant tree,
in a spring at the foot of which dwelt one of the six
&ldquo;cloud rulers,&rdquo; each attended by one of the six primal
Sia priestesses, chosen by the arch-mother to intercede
with the cloud rulers to send rain to the Sia.
The six trees were specified as the spruce, pine, aspen,
cedar, and two varieties of the oak.<a class="fn" id="fr_270" href="#fn_270">[270]</a></p>
<p>The beautiful conception met with in some of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
above traditions, by which the stars were compared at
once to gems and to the fruits of a mighty tree, is
frequently encountered in ancient literature. The
Arabians represented the zodiac as a tree with twelve
branches, of which the stars were the fruit, and a
somewhat similar idea appears in the Apocalyptic
tree of life, which &ldquo;bare twelve manner of fruits, and
yielded her fruit every month.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_271" href="#fn_271">[271]</a> The Babylonian
hero Gilgames, in his wanderings beyond the gates of
ocean, came upon a forest, which</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To the forest of the trees of the gods in appearance was equal;</p>
<p class="t7">Emeralds it carried as its fruit;</p>
<p class="t0">The branch refuses not to support a canopy;</p>
<p class="t7">Crystal they carried as shoots,</p>
<p class="t0">Fruit they carry and to the sight it is glistening.<a class="fn" id="fr_272" href="#fn_272">[272]</a></p>
</div>
<p>The device of a golden tree hung with jewels,
which is common throughout the East in all fine
goldsmiths&rsquo; work, and a good example of which was
formerly one of the treasures of the palace of the
Great Mogul at Agra,<a class="fn" id="fr_273" href="#fn_273">[273]</a> was no doubt derived from
the conception of a star-bearing world-tree. For it
must be remembered that the ancients believed gems
to be self-lustrous like the stars. Homer&rsquo;s palaces
emitted a radiance like moonlight, and the columns of
gold and emerald seen by Herodotus at Tyre gave
out light.<a class="fn" id="fr_274" href="#fn_274">[274]</a></p>
<p>We have no direct instance of gem-bearing trees
in Greek mythology, though the golden apples of the
Hesperides growing on Mount Atlas, the sky-sustaining
mountain in the country beyond the north wind,
had evidently some kinship to the jewelled fruit of
Eastern legend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>In addition to the Norse Yggdrasil, there are other
traces of the tradition of a world-tree to be met with
amongst European nations. The Russians have a
legend, derived from Byzantium, of an iron-tree, the
root of which is the power of God, while its head sustains
the three worlds, the heavenly ocean of air, the
earth, and hell with its burning fire and brimstone.<a class="fn" id="fr_275" href="#fn_275">[275]</a>
Amongst the Saxons the idea of a world-tree seems
to have persisted even to the time of Charlemagne,
who in the course of his campaign against them in
772 <span class="small">A.D.</span> solemnly destroyed as a heathen idol their
Irmens&ucirc;l or &ldquo;World-pillar,&rdquo; a lofty tree-trunk, which
they worshipped as typifying the universal column
that supports all things. Mannhardt, however, regards
the Irmens&ucirc;l as simply a national tree, corresponding
to the community trees already mentioned, and explains
Charlemagne&rsquo;s act as a political rather than a
religious one.<a class="fn" id="fr_276" href="#fn_276">[276]</a></p>
<p>In the Cathedral at Hildesheim there is an ancient
stone column known as the Irmens&auml;ule (though its
claim to the name is disputed), which was dug up
under Louis le D&eacute;bonnaire, and transformed into a
candelabrum surmounted by an image of the Virgin,<a class="fn" id="fr_277" href="#fn_277">[277]</a>
the conception of moral support thus taking the place
of the grosser idea of a material stay.</p>
<p>As in Eastern legend the universe-tree was
venerated as something more than a mere material
supporter of the world, being sometimes the giver of
wisdom and sometimes the conveyer of immortality,
so in European myth it is found linked with a similar
beneficence. In the legends of the Finns its branches
are represented as conferring &ldquo;eternal welfare,&rdquo; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
&ldquo;the delight that never ceases.&rdquo; The Kalevala, which
dates back to an unknown antiquity, relates how the
last of created trees, the oak, sprang from the magic
acorn planted by the hero Wainamoinen in the ashes
of burnt hay which had been mown by the water-maidens:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Spreads the oak-tree many branches,</p>
<p class="t0">Rounds itself a broad corona,</p>
<p class="t0">Raises it above the storm clouds;</p>
<p class="t0">Far it stretches out its branches,</p>
<p class="t0">Stops the white clouds in their courses,</p>

<p class="t0">With its many leaves the moonbeams,</p>

<p>At the prayer of Wainamoinen, appalled by the
monstrous growth, his mother, the wind-spirit, sends
a tiny water-creature, who, soon turning into a giant,
with a mighty swing of his hatchet strikes the tree.
With the second stroke he cuts it, and with the third
fire springs from its huge bulk and the oak yields,
&ldquo;shaking earth and heaven in falling.&rdquo; It is not till
then that its beneficent powers are made manifest:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Eastward far the trunk extending,</p>
<p class="t0">Far to westward flew the tree-tops,</p>
<p class="t0">To the south the leaves were scattered,</p>
<p class="t0">To the north its hundred branches.</p>
<p class="t0">Whosoe&rsquo;er a branch has taken</p>

</div>
<p>The corresponding legend amongst the neighbouring
Esthonians, as told in their epic, the Kalevipoeg,
contains a quaint medley of the practical and the
poetic. Here, too, the monstrous oak is felled by a
giant who grows from a dwarf; in falling it covers
the sea with its branches and is quickly turned to use
by the people. From the trunk is fashioned a bridge
with two arms, one stretching to Finland, the other
to an adjoining island. Ships are built from the
crown, and towns from the roots, and toy-boats from the
chips. What is left over is used to build shelters for
old men, widows, and orphans, and the last remainder
to provide a hut for the minstrel. Therewith he
gains &ldquo;the master-magic,&rdquo; for the strangers who cross
the bridge now and again, and stop at his door to ask
what city and what splendid palace stand before
them, receive for answer that the palace is his poor
hut, and all the splendour around is the light of his
songs reflected from heaven.<a class="fn" id="fr_279" href="#fn_279">[279]</a></p>
<p>To return again to the East, it has already been
mentioned that in a tradition common both to the
Persians and the Hindus, and therefore presumably of
considerable antiquity, the cosmic tree produced the
food whereby the gods preserved their immortality.
The universe-tree had become a tree of life.
This conception of a mystical life-giving tree was
associated with the ritual use of an earthly counterpart
of the immortalising drink.</p>
<p>According to the Persian tradition the haoma-tree
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
grew beside the tree of all seeds in a lake, where
it was guarded by two fish against the attacks of the
lizard sent by Ahriman to destroy the sacred sap
wherewith the gods were nourished. It was the first
of all trees planted by Ormuzd in the fountain of life,
and was identified with the god Haoma, who gave
strength and health to the body, and to the soul
enlightenment and eternal life. This god was
regarded as assimilated to the earthly haoma, and as
present in it. It is related in the sacred writings that
he appeared one day to Zoroaster as he was tending
the holy fire, and thus addressed him: &ldquo;I am the
divine Haoma, who keeps death at bay. Call upon
me, express my juice that ye may enjoy me; worship
me with songs of praise.&rdquo; Zoroaster replied, &ldquo;Honour
to Haoma. He is good, well, and truly born, the
giver of welfare and health, victorious and of golden
hue; his branches bow down that one may enjoy
them. To the soul he is the way to heaven. In the
beginning Ormuzd gave to Haoma the girdle glittering
with stars, wherewith he girded himself upon the
tops of the mountains.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_280" href="#fn_280">[280]</a></p>
<p>The juice of the terrestrial haoma was obtained
from the plant by the use of pestle and mortar, and was
taken whenever prayer was offered. Every house in
Persia had its haoma-plant and its sacred pestle and
mortar, which had to be protected from pollution as
carefully as the holy fire and the sacred myrtle-twigs.
The preparation of the haoma-drink had its special
liturgy, and in dedicating it the cup was held aloft, not
placed on the ground, lest it should be polluted by the
breath of the worshipper or other impurity.<a class="fn" id="fr_281" href="#fn_281">[281]</a> The
Semnion or Theombrotion which, according to Pliny,
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
was taken by the Persian kings to keep off bodily
decay and to produce constancy of mind, was probably
identical with the haoma-drink.<a class="fn" id="fr_282" href="#fn_282">[282]</a></p>
<p>The Parsees of Bombay still continue the ritual
use of the haoma-juice, deriving it from a plant with a
knotted stem and leaves like those of the jasmine,
supplies of which are specially obtained from Kirman
in Persia. They refuse to admit the identity of the
Vedic soma with their own sacred plant, which they
assert is never found in India.<a class="fn" id="fr_283" href="#fn_283">[283]</a></p>
<p>This fact, if true, would account for the confusion
which appears to exist as to the exact nature of the
plant from which the Vedic soma or amrita was
derived, and indeed it is very probable that in their
migrations southward the Hindus made use successively
of different plants. But there can be little
doubt that the soma ritual and the conceptions
associated with it were originally derived from the
same source as that of the haoma, and date back to
a period before the Aryan races had become separated.
Like the haoma, the soma is not only a plant but
also a powerful deity, and in both the Vedas and the
Zendavesta &ldquo;the conceptions of the god and the
sacred juice blend wonderfully with each other.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_284" href="#fn_284">[284]</a></p>
<p>According to Professor Roth, the plant which is
the source of the intoxicating drink offered to the
gods in Hindu sacrifices is the <i>Sarcostemma acidum</i>
or <i>Asclepias acida</i>, a leafless herb containing a milky
juice, but it is doubtful whether it is identical with the
Vedic soma plant.<a class="fn" id="fr_285" href="#fn_285">[285]</a> Dr. Haug states distinctly that
the plant at present used by the sacrificial priests of
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
the Deccan is not the soma of the Vedas. It grows
on the hills near Poona; its sap, which is whitish, is
bitter and astringent, but not sour; it is a very nasty
drink, but has some intoxicating effect. De Gubernatis
concludes that as the earthly drink was merely a
symbol of the heavenly soma, its source and character
were not material. It is not necessary that the drink
which the worshipper pretends to drink or to offer
to Indra at the sacrifice should be really intoxicating.
The object of the rite is to induce Indra in heaven to
drink the water of strength, the true soma, the real
ambrosia, sometimes conceived as hidden in the
clouds, sometimes as dwelling in the soft light poured
forth by the great Soma, Indu, the moon,&mdash;the tree
whose stem, long, dark, and leafless, resembles that of
the earthly plant from which the drink is ordered to
be prepared. The ritual resolves itself, according to
De Gubernatis, into a sun-charm. Soma, the moon,
the god of plants, the lord of the dark forest of night
or winter, is the good genius who furnishes the
miraculous drink wherewith Indra, the solar hero,
recruits his forces. It is under its influence, say the
Vedas, that Indra performs his great deeds. Soma
does really intoxicate the gods in heaven, incessantly
renewing the triumph of light over its enemies. The
sacrifice of the soma on earth is only a pale, na&iuml;ve,
and grotesque reproduction of that divine miracle.<a class="fn" id="fr_286" href="#fn_286">[286]</a></p>
<p>According to the Vedas, however, the soma-drink,
which Windischman describes as &ldquo;the holiest offering of
the ancient Indian worship,&rdquo; had a genuinely intoxicating
effect. It is described as &ldquo;stimulating speech,&rdquo;
&ldquo;calling forth the ardent thought,&rdquo; &ldquo;generating
hymns with the powers of a poet&rdquo;; and is invoked as
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
&ldquo;bestower of good, master of a thousand songs, the
leader of sages.&rdquo; A hymn in the Rig-Veda has been
thus translated:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We&rsquo;ve quaffed the Soma bright</p>
<p class="t">And are immortal grown,</p>
<p class="t0">We&rsquo;ve entered into light</p>
<p class="t">And all the gods have known.</p>
<p class="t0">What mortal now can harm</p>
<p class="t">Or foeman vex us more?</p>
<p class="t0">Through thee, beyond alarm,</p>
<p class="t">Immortal god! we soar.<a class="fn" id="fr_287" href="#fn_287">[287]</a></p>
</div>
<p>In the Hindu worship the fermented juice of the
soma-plant was presented in ladles to the deities
invoked, part sprinkled on the sacrificial fire, part on
the sacred grass strewed upon the floor, and the
remainder invariably drunk by those who conducted
the ceremony.<a class="fn" id="fr_288" href="#fn_288">[288]</a> In early times, says Windischman, its
use was looked upon as a holy action, and as a sacrament
by which the union with Brahma was obtained.</p>
<p>The <i>ambrosia</i> of the Olympian gods, like the word
itself, was no doubt in its essence identical with the
Vedic <i>amrita</i> or <i>soma</i>. It contained the principle of
immortality, and was hence withheld from mortals.
But the word was also applied, like the soma, to a
mixture of various fruits used in religious rites.<a class="fn" id="fr_289" href="#fn_289">[289]</a> A
still closer analogy, however, with the Hindu and
Persian conception is to be found in the cult of
Dionysus, who was regarded as present in the wine,
which was his gift to man. &ldquo;He, born a god,&rdquo; says
Euripides, &ldquo;is poured out in libations to the gods.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_290" href="#fn_290">[290]</a>
And again, &ldquo;This god is a prophet. For when he
forces his way into the body, he makes those who
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
rave to foretell the future.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_291" href="#fn_291">[291]</a> The fact that Dionysus
was essentially a tree-god, &ldquo;the spiritual form of the
vine,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_292" href="#fn_292">[292]</a> renders the analogy still more striking.</p>
<p>To discuss the genesis of the above conceptions
would be to reopen the whole question of the origin
of tree-worship. The drinking of vegetable juices,
fermented or otherwise, was no doubt one of the
means by which early races were accustomed to produce
dreams and visions, and so, in their view, to get
themselves possessed by or put into communication
with a spirit. It was natural, therefore, for them to
assume that the spirit in question had entered into
them with the drug, and was therefore present in it and
in the plant from which it was derived. Mr. Herbert
Spencer, indeed, argues that this particular assumption
was one of the chief factors in the origin of plant-worship
in general, a main reason why plants yielding
intoxicating agents, and hence other plants, came to
be regarded as containing supernatural beings.<a class="fn" id="fr_293" href="#fn_293">[293]</a> It
would probably, however, be safer to conclude that
the sacramental use of the juice of plants is merely
one amongst many cognate religious usages, and like
the ritual employment of wreaths in the service of the
gods, the attachment of branches to the house, and the
smiting with the &ldquo;life-rood,&rdquo; sprang out of the desire
of men to bring nearer to themselves a spirit already
believed to exist, and thus to ensure their enjoyment
of the protection and the benefits presumed to be at
his disposal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">PARADISE</span></h2>
<p>No account of tree-worship would be complete without
a chapter on that tradition of a paradise or ideal garden
of delight which is met with in the mythology of
almost all the nations of antiquity. The form of the
tradition varies. Paradise was sometimes represented
(1) as the seat of the gods; sometimes (2) as the first
home of the parents of mankind; and in other cases
as (3) the abode of the spirits of the blessed. Occasionally
the different conceptions are combined; but
the earlier traditions all concur in connecting paradise
with a miraculous tree or trees, or with a more or less
legendary mountain, from which it may be plausibly
inferred that they date back to the days of that primitive
cosmogony when the heavens were supposed to
be upheld by a material support. Thus in one, at
least, of its aspects the tradition of paradise must be
regarded as an offshoot of the sacred tree.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to understand how the various
conceptions arose. In the first place, as the idea of a
life or spirit more or less bound to the tree became
expanded into that of a powerful and wide-ranging
god, the idealising process demanded for him some
home in heaven corresponding to the tree which was
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
his favourite habitat or embodiment on earth. The
sacred god-haunted tree, to which worship and gifts
were accorded below, suggested a mystical counterpart
above, and the proper home of deity was assumed
to be that marvellous tree whose branches
were the sky and its fruit the sun and stars, or that
lofty mountain whose summit touched and supported
the heavens.</p>
<p>In the second place, the belief, common in primitive
mythology, that the first parents were born from
trees, presumably led to the idea that these honoured
ancestors, whose innocence was a part of their idealisation,
lived amongst trees and in a garden equally
idealised.</p>
<p>The third conception of paradise naturally grew
out of the earlier conceptions, when there arose the
belief in a future life of reward or punishment; though
it has been pointed out that the conception of heaven
under the form of a garden prevailed, <i>par excellence</i>,
amongst settled nations, living under kings of whose
state a luxurious garden or pleasaunce formed an
essential part.<a class="fn" id="fr_294" href="#fn_294">[294]</a></p>
<p>Of paradise regarded as the abode of the gods, the
Indian tradition of the garden of Indra furnishes the
best example. It was situated on Mount Meru, on the
confines of Cashmere, and contained the five wonderful
trees which sprang from the waters, after the
churning of the cosmic ocean by the gods and the
demons. Under these trees the gods took their ease,
enjoying the ambrosia that fell from them. The
garden, watered by springs and rivulets, contained
luminous flowers, fruits that conferred immortality,
and birds whose song even the gods loved to hear.
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
The chief of its five miraculous trees was the paridjata,
the flower of which preserved its freshness
throughout the year, contained in itself every scent
and flavour, and gave happiness to whoever demanded
it. It was, moreover, a test of virtue, losing its
splendour in the hands of the sinful, and preserving
it for him who followed duty. Each person found in
it his favourite colour and perfume. It served as a
torch by night, was a talisman against hunger, thirst,
disease, and decrepitude, and discoursed the sweetest
and most varied music.<a class="fn" id="fr_295" href="#fn_295">[295]</a> De Gubernatis quotes several
other instances from Indian literature of a legendary
celestial garden.<a class="fn" id="fr_296" href="#fn_296">[296]</a></p>
<div class="img" id="fig29">

<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 28.</span>&mdash;From a Babylonian seal.<br />(Goblet d&rsquo;Alviella.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Of paradise, as the home of the first parents, the
Pentateuch gives the most circumstantial account,
though it would appear from Genesis iii. 8 that the
Biblical paradise was also regarded as a favourite
resort of Jehovah. The sacred books of the Parsis
contain a very similar version. The original human
pair, Maschia and Maschi&acirc;na, sprang from a tree in
Heden, a delightful spot where grew hom or haoma,
the marvellous tree of life, whose fruit imparted
vigour and immortality. The woman, at the instance
of Ahriman, the spirit of evil in the guise
of a serpent, gave her husband fruit to eat and
so led to their ruin.<a class="fn" id="fr_297" href="#fn_297">[297]</a>
The tradition is no doubt of very ancient origin, and
is supposed to be represented on an early Babylonian
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
seal now in the British Museum. The tree stands in
the middle, from either side two human beings seated
stretch forth their hands for its fruit; the serpent
stands erect behind one of them.<a class="fn" id="fr_298" href="#fn_298">[298]</a> On another
cylinder in the Museum at the Hague there is represented
a garden with trees and birds; in the middle
a palm, from which two personages are plucking the
fruit; a third with a fruit in his hand seems to address
them.<a class="fn" id="fr_299" href="#fn_299">[299]</a></p>
<p>The two mystical trees of the Biblical paradise
find their common counterpart in the sacred cedar
of the Chaldaeans, which, besides being essentially
a tree of life, employed in magic rites to restore
strength and life to the body, was also &ldquo;the revealer
of the oracles of earth and heaven.&rdquo; Upon its core
the name of Ea, the god of wisdom, was supposed to
be written,<a class="fn" id="fr_300" href="#fn_300">[300]</a> just as the name of Ormuzd was first
disclosed to man by appearing carved in the wood of
his sacred cypress. The tree of life also finds a
parallel in the divine soma, the giver of eternal youth
and immortality, a drink reserved only for the celestial
gods or the souls of the blessed.</p>
<p>The third conception of paradise, as the dwelling-place
of the righteous dead, is met with in the earliest
Greek literature,<a class="fn" id="fr_301" href="#fn_301">[301]</a> but there is no definite trace of it
amongst the Semitic nations until much later. It did
not, apparently, find recognition amongst the Jews until
after the exile, but references to it are frequent in
their later apocalyptic literature.<a class="fn" id="fr_302" href="#fn_302">[302]</a> In the second book
of Esdras, the Lord tells His people that He will
bring them out of the tombs, and that He has sanctified
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
and prepared for them &ldquo;twelve trees, laden with
divers fruits, and as many fountains flowing with milk
and honey, and seven mighty mountains, whereupon
there grow roses and lilies.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_303" href="#fn_303">[303]</a> &ldquo;They shall have the
tree of life for an ointment of sweet savour; they
shall neither labour nor be weary.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_304" href="#fn_304">[304]</a></p>
<p>In the Rabbinical writings, and still more in the
Koran, this conception of paradise is embroidered
with many fanciful extravagances. The Talmud even
invents two paradises. &ldquo;There is an upper paradise
and a lower paradise. And between them is fixed a
pillar, by which they are joined together, and which
is called &lsquo;The strength of the Hill of Sion.&rsquo; And
by this pillar on every Sabbath and festival the souls
of the righteous ascend from the lower to the upper
paradise, and there enjoy the light of the Divine
Majesty till the end of the Sabbath or festival, when
they descend and return into the lower paradise.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_305" href="#fn_305">[305]</a></p>
<p>This pillar is no doubt a survival of the old tradition
of the world-tree, a tradition still more obviously
traceable in the Mahometan belief. According to
the Koran paradise is situated in the seventh heaven.
In the centre of it stands the marvellous tree called
<i>Tooba</i>, which is so large that a man mounted on the
fleetest horse could not ride round its branches in a
hundred years. This tree not only affords the most
grateful shade over the whole extent of the Mussulman
paradise, but its boughs, laden with delicious fruits
of a size and taste unknown to mortals, bend themselves
to be plucked at the wish of the happy denizens
of that blissful abode. The rivers of paradise take
their rise from the tree, flowing some with water,
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
some with milk, and some with honey; while others
are filled with wine, the use of which is not forbidden
to the blessed.<a class="fn" id="fr_306" href="#fn_306">[306]</a></p>
<p>The confusion of thought apparent in these ancient
traditions of paradise was no doubt partly due to the
fact that primitive man, with his limited grasp of the
possibilities of space, pictured heaven as not far distant
from him. It was a happier and a brighter earth,
which offered material rather than spiritual joys, and
where, according to the earliest conceptions, the spirits
of the departed carried on the same pursuits, reaped
and sowed and hunted, as they had done while in life.
Thus the old Accadian dwellers by the Euphrates
pictured the sky as the counterpart of their own fertile
plains, and the sun as a ploughman yoking his oxen to
the glittering plough, with which he tilled the heavenly
pasture.<a class="fn" id="fr_307" href="#fn_307">[307]</a> The same idea is exemplified in the names
of the zodiacal constellations, which are of extremely
ancient origin, the sign we still know as Taurus
being called by the Accadians &ldquo;the bull who guides
the year.&rdquo; So near was heaven that it was not impossible
to climb up to it, if you could but find the cosmic
tree by which it was upheld. The Khasias of India
have a legend that the stars are men who have climbed
into heaven by a tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_308" href="#fn_308">[308]</a> The Mbocobis of Paraguay
still believe that the souls of the dead go up &ldquo;to the
earth on high&rdquo; by the tree which joins us to heaven,
and find an entrance by means of the holes in the
sky-roof through which the rain descends.<a class="fn" id="fr_309" href="#fn_309">[309]</a> There
is a Chinese story of a king, who having heard of the
glories of paradise, set forth in search of it. After
long wanderings he came to a mighty column, which,
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
he had been told, must be climbed in order to reach
the wished-for goal. But it was too slippery, and he
was compelled to fall back upon the alternative route,
a steep and rugged mountain path. When almost
fainting with fatigue he was assisted by some friendly
nymphs, and at length arrived at a beautiful garden,
with a wondrous tree in its midst, and a fountain of
immortality, from which four rivers, flowing to the four
corners of the earth, took their rise.<a class="fn" id="fr_310" href="#fn_310">[310]</a></p>
<p>The same notion of the similarity and propinquity
of the heavenly field is illustrated by the story of the
Etruscan priest, who by his charms brought down to
earth a bit of heaven whereon to build his temple.
The Mahometans assert that the Caaba was lowered
directly from the celestial paradise exactly at the
centre of the earth. And the Bedouins of Arabia
still believe that the jinni, living near the lowest
heaven, can hear the conversation of the angels, and
so gain valuable information which they are able to
impart to men.<a class="fn" id="fr_311" href="#fn_311">[311]</a></p>
<p>Homer placed the seat of the gods and the court
of Zeus upon the summit of Olympus,<a class="fn" id="fr_312" href="#fn_312">[312]</a> which was supposed
to touch heaven, and piercing through the region
of rain and cloud to reach into the calm ether, where
reigned eternal spring. By later writers, however,
Olympus was represented as an unsubstantial region
overhead, with the palace of Zeus in its midst. The
earlier view of Olympus exactly corresponds with the
Chaldaean &ldquo;mount of the world,&rdquo; the mountain of
Arallu or Hades, where the gods had their seat, and
beneath which was the world of ghosts;<a class="fn" id="fr_313" href="#fn_313">[313]</a> also with the
Mount of the Assembly spoken of by Isaiah, and with
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
the Scandinavian Asgard. But there is a clearer
reminiscence of the elevated paradise of Oriental
legend in the beautiful gardens of the world-supporting
Atlas, with their delicious fruits, their golden
apples, and their protecting dragon. The third conception
of paradise, as the abode of the blessed, is
also met with in Greek mythology in the Elysian
fields, or islands of the blessed, also placed by some
authorities in the neighbourhood of Mount Atlas.
Here the souls of the virtuous enjoyed perfect happiness,
in bowers for ever green, and amongst meadows watered
by pleasant streams and bestarred with asphodel. The
air was pure and serene, the birds warbled in the groves,
and the inhabitants carried on such avocations as they
had delighted in when on earth. Later writers,
however, substituted for these innocent pleasures the
voluptuous indulgences of the Mahometan paradise.</p>
<p>It was, no doubt, the ancient tradition of an elevated
paradise, of a paradise seated on the summit of a
heaven-touching world-mountain, which influenced
Milton in his celebrated description, for there is nothing
in the Biblical account to suggest the excessive
altitude that he so deliberately accentuates. Paradise,
according to the poet&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t4">crowns with her enclosure green,</p>
<p class="t0">As with a rural mound, the champain head</p>
<p class="t0">Of a steep wilderness, ...</p>
<p class="t6">and overhead up-grew</p>
<p class="t0">Insuperable height of loftiest shade,</p>
<p class="t0">Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm;</p>
<p class="t6">... Yet higher than their tops</p>
<p class="t0">The verdurous wall of paradise up-sprung.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * *</span></p>
<p class="t0">And higher than that wall a circling row</p>
<p class="t0">Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit.<a class="fn" id="fr_314" href="#fn_314">[314]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>As man&rsquo;s conceptions of God have widened with
a more extended knowledge of His universe and a
fuller realisation of his own history on the earth, these
older conceptions of paradise as the home of deity
and the abode of the blessed have decayed, until at the
present day, however much our theologians may differ
in their descriptions of heaven, they agree at least in this,
that whatever it is, it is not a garden. But the belief
in the existence of an earthly paradise, which formed
a part of the traditions of so many ancient nations,
lingered on for centuries after &ldquo;the Holy City&rdquo; of the
New Testament had displaced the Paradise of the Old.</p>
<p>The features of this earthly paradise are for the
most part similar to those familiar to us in the Biblical
description. It contained the fountain of immortality,
from which sprang the four rivers that flowed to the
four quarters of the earth. Purling brooks ran with
the far-famed ambrosia. The dwellers therein reposed
on flowery lawns, lulled by the melodious warblings of
birds and feasting on delicious fruits. Whatever there
was of beautiful or sublime in nature there found its
more perfect counterpart. Absolute contentment and
serenity and the delight that never dies were the boons
it offered. There man could cease from toil, for nature,
unassisted, produced all that was necessary for his
sustenance. This garden of delight was often sought
after but seldom found, except by semi-divine heroes
divinely led. Hercules, directed by Nereus, the sea-god,
succeeded in attaining the gardens of the Hesperides
on the world-supporting Mount Atlas, the
Pillar of Heaven, as Herodotus calls it. He conquered
the protecting dragon and secured the golden
sun-fruit from the central tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_315" href="#fn_315">[315]</a> The Chaldaean
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
Hercules, Gilgames, referred to in a previous chapter,
found a similar tree with magic fruit upon it when he
reached the gates of ocean.</p>
<p>This idea of an actual paradise upon earth has
fascinated the mind of man in all ages, and has been
one of his most cherished and persistent traditions. It
was an idea that no doubt arose out of and corresponded
to his lifelong craving for a perfect peace and happiness
which he never found in the world he knew, and which
he has at length realised to be incompatible with his
own organisation. It has taken him centuries to discover
that if there is no earthly paradise it is he himself
and not the world that is at fault. But the tradition
was slow to die, and there are probably people who
still believe, as Sir John Maundeville believed in the
fourteenth century, that the Garden of Eden exists
somewhere upon the earth if it could only be found.
This is what the famous traveller says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And beyond the land, and isles, and deserts of
Prester John&rsquo;s lordship, in going straight towards the
East, men find nothing but mountains and great rocks;
and there is the dark region, where no man may see,
neither by day nor night, as they of the country say.
And that desert, and that place of darkness, lasts from
this coast unto Terrestrial Paradise, where Adam, our
first father, and Eve were put, who dwelt there but a
little while, and that is towards the east, at the beginning
of the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Paradise I cannot properly speak, for I was not
there. It is far beyond; and I repent not going there,
but I was not worthy. But as I have heard say of
wise men beyond, I shall tell you with good-will.
Terrestrial Paradise, as wise men say, is the highest
place of the earth; and it is so high that it nearly
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
touches the circle of the moon, there as the moon
makes her turn. For it is so high that the flood of
Noah might not come to it, that would have covered
all the earth of the world all about, and above and
beneath, except Paradise. And this Paradise is
enclosed all about with a wall, and men know not
whereof it is; for the wall is covered all over with
moss, as it seems; and it seems not that the wall is
natural stone. And that wall stretches from the south
to the north; and it has but one entry, which is closed
with burning fire, so that no man that is mortal dare
enter. And in the highest place of Paradise, exactly
in the middle, is a well that casts out four streams,
which run by divers lands, of which the first is called
Pison or Ganges, that runs through India or Emlak,
in which river are many precious stones, and much
lignum alo&euml;s, and much sand of gold. And the other
river is called Nile or Gyson, which goes through
Ethiopia, and after through Egypt. And the other is
called Tigris, which runs by Assyria and by Armenia
the Great. And the other is called Euphrates, which
runs through Media, Armenia, and Persia. And men
there beyond say that all the sweet waters of the world,
above and beneath, take their beginning from the well
of Paradise; and out of that well all waters come and
go.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_316" href="#fn_316">[316]</a></p>
<p>The paradise in the existence of which the great
traveller so firmly believed is represented in a thirteenth-century
map as a circular island lying to the east of
India, and the cartographer has not forgotten to introduce
even the gate from which our first parents were
expelled.</p>
<p>A fourteenth-century Icelandic saga describes a
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
voyage undertaken by a prince and his chosen friend
in search of the Deathless Land. They first went to
Constantinople to consult the Emperor, and were told
that the earthly paradise was slightly to the south of
India. Arrived in that country they continued the
journey on horseback, and came at last to a dense
forest, the gloom of which was so great through the
interlacing of the boughs that even by day the stars
could be seen. Emerging from it they saw, across
a strait, a beautiful land, which was unmistakably
paradise. The strait was crossed by a stone bridge
guarded by a dragon. The prince, in no ways deterred,
walked deliberately sword in hand against the
dragon, and the next moment, to his infinite surprise
and delight, he found himself in paradise. Here he
encountered all the joys heart could desire, and exhausted
with delight he fell asleep. In his dreams his
guardian angel appeared to him and promised to lead
him home, but to come for him again and take him
away for ever at the expiration of the tenth year.<a class="fn" id="fr_317" href="#fn_317">[317]</a></p>
<p>Many other mediaeval stories could be quoted, in
which the traveller claims to have found paradise. It
was a favourite subject with the court minstrels, proving
that even the envied dwellers around a throne are not
less open than other men to the fascinating dream of a
still more perfect happiness.</p>
<p>Plato&rsquo;s story of the lost Atlantis, supposed to have
been related to Solon when in Egypt, also belongs to
the class of paradise legends. It was situated in the
Atlantic, in the neighbourhood of the Pillars of Hercules.
Larger than Libya and Asia together, it was the seat
of a great and wonderful empire, the subjects of which,
after many conquests, set out to subdue Hellas, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
were defeated by the Athenians. Shortly afterwards
there arose violent earthquakes and floods, and in a
single day and night the island disappeared beneath the
sea. All this happened 9000 years before the time of
Plato.<a class="fn" id="fr_318" href="#fn_318">[318]</a> According to other accounts, when the gods distributed
the whole earth amongst themselves Atlantis
fell to the lot of Poseidon, and the children he had by
Cleito, a mortal, ruled over the surrounding country.
The eldest, Atlas, gave his name to the island and to
the Atlantic Ocean. This sacred land brought forth
in abundance the most beautiful and delicious fruits,
and magnificent buildings were constructed from the
minerals and fragrant woods of the place, notably a
holy temple dedicated to Poseidon and Cleito, which
was protected by an enclosure of gold. A wealth of
fountains and hot and cold springs supplied luxurious
baths. The government was humane and just, and the
people took their due share in it. So long as the divine
nature lasted in them they were obedient to the laws
and well affected to the gods, their kinsmen, evincing
gentleness and wisdom in the various chances of life
and in their intercourse with each other, and setting
more value on virtue than on wealth and luxury. But
in the end, as the divine part in them died away, they
fell from virtue, and they and their island were submerged
for ever beneath the waves.</p>
<p>This legend, which would appear to combine with
the idea of an earthly paradise another tradition equally
familiar to antiquity, that of a retributory deluge, survived
into the Middle Ages, and became blended with
the legends of the Celtic Church. For the Atlantic
paradise is distinctly reproduced in that legendary
Isle of Avalon,<a class="fn" id="fr_319" href="#fn_319">[319]</a> which St. Brandan, an Irish saint of
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
the sixth century, was said to have found in the course
of a seven years&rsquo; voyage; the isle&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Where falls not hail or rain or any snow,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor ever wind blows loudly, but it lies</p>
<p class="t0">Deep-meadowed, happy, fair, with orchard lawns</p>
<p class="t0">And bowery hollows.</p>
</div>
<p>Columbus, in his third voyage, came upon a spot,
the site of which corresponded with the description
given of the earthly paradise by &ldquo;holy and wise
theologians.&rdquo; But he hesitated to <i>ascend</i> thither and
assure himself of the correctness of his conclusion, as
no one could succeed in such an undertaking without
the divine permission.<a class="fn" id="fr_320" href="#fn_320">[320]</a></p>
<p>The Japanese have a legend of an Island of Eternal
Youth, which exists beyond the horizon in the shadowy
unknown. Some fortunate observers have from time
to time seen a wondrous tree rising high above the
waves. It is the tree which has stood for all ages on
the loftiest peak of Fusan, the Mountain of Immortality.
The island has the traditional characteristics of the
earthly paradise,&mdash;endless spring, airs ever sweet, unclouded
skies, unfading flowers, birds that sing of love
and joy, trees whose celestial dews carry with them the
secret of eternity. Sorrow, pain, and death are unknown,
and the elect of the gods, who people that
delightful spot, fill their days with music and laughter
and song, knowing nothing of the flight of time. The
miracle of the spring in other lands is due to the
whisper of the spirit of the island.<a class="fn" id="fr_321" href="#fn_321">[321]</a></p>
<p>This Japanese legend preserves the intimate connection
between paradise and the cosmic tree, which
is often found to have dropped out of other versions of
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
the tradition. There can be no doubt, however, that
originally the mystical tree was the essential feature of
paradise, and the garden was merely its precinct or
setting&mdash;one of the many conceptions which grew up
around the central idea of the cosmic tree. Each
nation, according to its stage of culture or its prevailing
habit of thought, emphasised one feature of it. The
monster tree which, according to primitive cosmogony,
was believed to support the universe by material
branches, became in the minds of more cultivated
races the central tree of a dimly-realised paradise, and
eventually the symbol of an abstract idea. The intellectual
Buddhist saw in it the emblem of knowledge;
the Persian thought of it as the tree of immortality;
the Hebrew, filled with the idea of man&rsquo;s frailty and
with the longing to explain it, made it the tree of
temptation.<a class="fn" id="fr_322" href="#fn_322">[322]</a></p>
<p>But in all these various conceptions we find a
central idea, derived no doubt from an antecedent and
universal tree-worship, an idea which places a tree at
the root of all philosophy, refers all phenomena to the
existence of a central tree, serviceable to man here or
hereafter, and concentrating upon itself the reverent
devotion which had outgrown its earthly counterpart.</p>
<p>There are many facts to prove the importance
attached in ancient times to this conception of a
glorified tree. Amongst the gorgeous decorations of
the palaces of Eastern kings a symbolical representation
of the tree of paradise was frequently found.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Tall as the cedar of the mountain, here</p>
<p class="t0">Rose the gold branches, hung with emerald leaves,</p>
<p class="t0">Blossomed with pearls, and rich with ruby fruit.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Sir John Maundeville describes one which he saw
in the palace of the Chan of Cathay. &ldquo;It is a vine
made of fine gold, which spreads all about the hall, and
it has many clusters of grapes, some white, some green,
some yellow, some red, and some black, all of precious
stones; the white are of crystal, beryl, and iris; the
yellow of topazes; the red of rubies, grenaz, and
alabraundines; the green of emeralds and perydoz and
of chrysolites; and the black of onyx and garnets.
And they are all so properly made that it appears a
real vine, bearing natural grapes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_323" href="#fn_323">[323]</a></p>
<p>According to an Arab writer, quoted by Gibbon,<a class="fn" id="fr_324" href="#fn_324">[324]</a>
there existed in the magnificent palace of the Caliph of
Bagdad, in 917 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, amongst other spectacles of rare
and stupendous luxury, a tree of gold and silver,
spreading into eighteen large branches, on which and
on the lesser boughs sat a variety of birds made of the
same precious metals. While the machinery effected
spontaneous motions the several birds warbled their
natural harmony. The intention was, no doubt, to
represent the traditional luxuriance of paradise, and a
similar motive is met with in Eastern design even in
the present day.</p>
<p>The tradition of a king who built a false paradise,
like Sheddad in Southey&rsquo;s <i>Thalaba</i>, seems always to
have been current in Western Asia. There is in the
British Museum a sculpture from Koyunjik representing
a palace, or may be a temple, constructed in imitation
of a paradise. The artificial hill, representing the
world-mountain on which it stands, is planted with
trees and flowers, and watered by a stream that issues
from a hanging garden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">MAY CELEBRATIONS</span></h2>
<p>In these days, when so much is done to equalise the
seasons, when in the flower-shops spring treads on
the heels of autumn, and Christmas windows are gay
with tropical fruits, when fresh meat is always on the
stalls, and the earth is tapped of its light and warmth to
make up for the absent sun, it is difficult to realise the
delight and enthusiasm with which our forefathers
welcomed the yearly miracle of the spring. It meant
so much to them,&mdash;release from the cold and the darkness
that fell hardly on all but the rich; a feast of
colour to eyes weary of winter grays; luscious, varied,
and plentiful food to palates dulled by salt meat and
pease-pudding. No wonder that the first hint of the
sun&rsquo;s return at Christmas, and the fulfilment of the
promise of spring at May-day, were welcomed with
an abandonment of joy to which our modern festivals
offer but a pale parallel. It is doubtful, however,
whether, even in the far-off days when the ceremonies
possessed the highest religious sanction and significance,
they were celebrated with a finer exuberance than in
the comparatively recent times when this country was
still &ldquo;merrie England.&rdquo; Fetching in the May or
going a-Maying was then a most important festival,
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
in which people of all ranks took part. Henry VIII.
himself rode a-Maying with Queen Katharine and his
Court. Every village had its May-pole, and the first
of May was everywhere &ldquo;the maddest, merriest day
of all the glad New Year.&rdquo; The celebration was
recognised by the Roman Church, the note for the
30th of April in an old Calendar being, &ldquo;The boys go
out and seek May-trees.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_325" href="#fn_325">[325]</a> Chaucer represents the
whole Court as going into the fields &ldquo;on May-day
when the lark begins to rise&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To fetch the floures fresh and branch and blome.</p>
<p class="t0">And namely hawthorne brought both page and grome,</p>
<p class="t0">With fresh&euml; garlants party blew and white,</p>
<p class="t0">And than rejoysen in their great delight.<a class="fn" id="fr_326" href="#fn_326">[326]</a></p>
</div>
<p>The poet makes the whole Court pelt each other
with flowers, &ldquo;the primerose, the violete and the gold,&rdquo;
but the general custom was to bring home the branches
and flowers as an adornment for the house. Even the
barns and the cow-byres were carefully decorated, long
after the primitive intention of the ceremony had been
forgotten, and it had degenerated into a licensed
opportunity for revelry and love-making.</p>
<p>The two aspects of the celebration, the decorative
and the amatory, are charmingly illustrated in this lyric
of Herrick&rsquo;s:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, my Corinna, come; and coming mark</p>
<p class="t0">How each field turns a street, each street a park,</p>
<p class="t2">Made green and trimmed with trees: see how</p>
<p class="t2">Devotion gives each house a bough</p>
<p class="t2">Or branch: each porch, each door ere this</p>
<p class="t2">An ark, a tabernacle is,</p>
<p class="t0">Made up of white-thorn neatly interwove,</p>
<p class="t0">As if here were those cooler shades of love.</p>
<p class="t2">Can such delights be in the street</p>
<p class="t2">And open fields and we not see&rsquo;t?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p class="t2">Come, we&rsquo;ll abroad; and let&rsquo;s obey</p>
<p class="t2">The proclamation made for May:</p>
<p class="t0">And sin no more, as we have done by staying;</p>
<p class="t0">But, my Corinna, come, let&rsquo;s go a-Maying.</p>
</div>
<p>The lover of old customs owes little to the Puritans,
for they did their best to root them out, but he is
certainly indebted to them incidentally for some
valuable evidence as to those same customs, not otherwise
attainable. Stubbs, a Puritan writer of the time
of Elizabeth, thus describes the setting up of the Maypole
in his time:&mdash;&ldquo;But their cheefest jewell they
bring from thence (the woods) in their Maie Poole,
whiche they bring home with greate veneration as
thus: They have twentie or fourtie yoke of oxen,
every oxe havyng a sweete nosegaie of flowers tyed
on the tippe of his hornes, and these oxen drawe home
this Maie poole (this stinckyng idoll rather) which is
covered all over with flowers and hearbes, bounde
rounde aboute with stringes, from top to bottome, and
sometimes painted with variable colours, with twoo or
three hundred men, women, and children followyng it
with greate devotion. And thus beyng reared up with
handkercheifes and flagges streamyng on the toppe,
they strawe the grounde aboute, binde greene boughes
about it, sett up sommer-haules, bowers, and arbours
hard by it. And then fall they to banquet and feast,
to leape and daunce aboute it, as the Heathen people
did at the dedication of their idolles, whereof this is a
perfect patterne, or rather the thyng itself.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_327" href="#fn_327">[327]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;What adoe make our yong men at the time of
May?&rdquo; cries another Puritan writer. &ldquo;Do they not
use night-watchings to rob and steale young trees out
of other men&rsquo;s grounde, and bring them home into
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
their parishe, with minstrels playing before: and when
they have set it up they will decke it with floures and
garlands and daunce rounde (men and women togither,
moste unseemley and intolerable, as I have proved
before) about the tree, like unto the children of Israell
that daunced about the golden calfe that they had
set up.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_328" href="#fn_328">[328]</a></p>
<p>Thomas Hall, another author of the same class,
was also moved to eloquence on the subject: &ldquo;Had
this rudeness been acted only in some ignorant and
obscure parts of the land I had been silent; but when
I perceived that the complaints were general from all
parts of the land, and that even in Cheapside itself the
rude rabble had set up this ensign of profaneness, and
had put the Lord Mayor to the trouble of seeing it
pulled down, I could not, out of my dearest respects
and tender compassion to the land of my nativity,
and for the prevention of like disorders (if possible)
for the future, but put pen to paper, and discover
the sinful use and vile profaneness that attend such
misrule.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_329" href="#fn_329">[329]</a></p>
<p>As every one knows, the Puritans had their will
of the May-poles, and the Long Parliament in April
1644 decreed their removal as &ldquo;a heathenish vanity,
generally abused to superstition and wickednesse.&rdquo;
They were indeed reinstated after the Restoration
and the old festivities revived, but the Puritan epoch
had left its mark upon the spirit of the people, and
May-day was never again quite what it had been, so
that the following lament by a writer of Cromwell&rsquo;s
time was not quite out of date even when King Charles
had again come to his own:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Happy the age and harmlesse were the dayes</p>
<p class="t0">(For then true love and amity was found)</p>
<p class="t0">When every village did a May-pole raise,</p>
<p class="t0">And Whitsun-ales and May-games did abound,</p>
<p class="t0">And all the lusty yonkers in a rout</p>
<p class="t0">With merry lasses daunc&rsquo;d the rod about.</p>
<p class="t0">Then Friendship to their banquets bid the guests</p>
<p class="t0">And poor men far&rsquo;d the better for their feasts.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * *</span></p>
<p class="t0">But since the Summer poles were overthrown,</p>
<p class="t0">And all good sports and merriments decayed,</p>
<p class="t0">How times and men are chang&rsquo;d so well is knowne,</p>
<p class="t0">It were but labour lost if more were said.</p>
</div>
<p>In England the once universal joy-making on the
first of May has dwindled into a mere eleemosynary
device, and every year takes away something even from
this poor survival. We are only reminded of the day
in London by here and there a peripatetic Jack-in-the-Green
with his retinue of begging clowns, by the
gay ribbons on a few draught horses, and by the newspaper
reports of the election of Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s May-queen
at Whitelands College. But in many old-world
towns and villages throughout the country the children
still carry round wands, with bunches of flowers tied
to them, or garlands, consisting of a little bower
fashioned out of two crossed hoops, hidden in flowers,
with a doll seated in the centre. The obvious intention
of this pretty custom is the collection of coppers,
which no one will grudge. It is, so to say, a religious
ceremony, whereof only the collection has survived, as
the following old rhyme sufficiently illustrates:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Gentlemen and ladies!</p>
<p class="t0">We wish you happy May;</p>
<p class="t0">We&rsquo;ve come to show our garlands,</p>
<p class="t0">Because it is May-day;</p>
<p class="t0">Come, kiss my face, and smell my mace,</p>
<p class="t0">And give the lord and lady something.<a class="fn" id="fr_330" href="#fn_330">[330]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>In place of the final couplet it was sometimes the
custom of one of the bearers to say, &ldquo;Please to handsel
the lord and lady&rsquo;s purse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The practice once current in the North of England
of going into the woods on the first of May, &ldquo;when
the day begins to break,&rdquo; and bringing home &ldquo;knots
of flowers and buds and garlands gay&rdquo; wherewith to
adorn the windows and doors of the houses at sunrise,
is illustrated in the following doggrel, which used to
be sung in the streets of Newcastle-on-Tyne:<a class="fn" id="fr_331" href="#fn_331">[331]</a>&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Rise up, maidens, fie for shame!</p>
<p class="t0">For I&rsquo;ve been four long miles from hame;</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ve been gathering my garland gay,</p>
<p class="t0">Rise up, fair maids, and take in your May.</p>
</div>
<p>It now remains to trace back these ceremonies&mdash;these
survivals&mdash;to their origin, and to show how once
they were the essential outcome of a living creed, and
had a serious, and, so to speak, sacramental significance.<a class="fn" id="fr_332" href="#fn_332">[332]</a>
The May-day celebrations combined three different
usages. <i>First</i>, the bringing in of the May and the
decoration of the homestead. <i>Secondly</i>, the planting
of the May-pole and the dancing around it. <i>Thirdly</i>,
the selection of some youth or maiden as King or
Queen of the May.</p>
<p>(1) The custom of going to the woods to fetch in
the May is not by any means peculiar to England. It
was until recently very general throughout Europe,
and still survives in many districts, though sometimes
Whitsuntide or Midsummer is the date chosen for the
ceremony. This wide distribution at once stamps it
as an ancient observance, and indeed it was already
represented as such so long ago as the thirteenth
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
century.<a class="fn" id="fr_333" href="#fn_333">[333]</a> In some districts the branches that were
brought in were fastened over the house door or upon
the roof, or planted in front of the cattle stalls, a
separate bush being attached for each head of cattle.
Here the acknowledged purpose was to make the cows
good milkers. &ldquo;They fancy,&rdquo; says a writer on the
manners of the Irish, &ldquo;that a green bough fastened on
May-day against the house will produce plenty of milk
that summer.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_334" href="#fn_334">[334]</a> In other districts the May-bushes
were decorated with nosegays and ribbons and carried
in solemn procession from house to house, the bearers
singing a song and collecting their recompense in a
basket. In some parts of Sweden on May-day eve
boys still go round at the heels of the village fiddler,
each with a bunch of freshly-gathered birch-twigs,
singing songs in which fine weather, good harvests, and
other blessings are entreated. At every cottage where
they are duly compensated for their pains they adorn
the door with one of their birch-sprays. In Stockholm
on St. John&rsquo;s eve miniature May-poles, known as Majst&auml;nger,
are sold by the thousand.<a class="fn" id="fr_335" href="#fn_335">[335]</a> In Russia the
custom of decking the houses with branches at Whitsuntide
is universal.<a class="fn" id="fr_336" href="#fn_336">[336]</a> Similar instances might be
multiplied indefinitely.</p>
<p>Much light has been thrown on these May-day
ceremonies by the study of many cognate observances
met with amongst different nations and at different
periods. In Western Germany and over the greater
part of France it is customary at harvest-time to
select a green sapling or branch, adorn it with flowers,
ribbons, and coloured paper, and hang it with harvest
fruits, eggs, cakes, and sweetmeats, and sometimes
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
even with sausages, rolls of tobacco, rings, needles, etc.
Often bottles of wine or beer are also suspended to it.
It is known as the May, harvest-May, <i>bouquet de la
moisson</i>, and it is frequently set up in the field which
is in process of cutting. When the reaping is over it
is brought home on the last sheaf or on the last load,
or is borne by a harvestman seated on the waggon or
walking before it. On its arrival at the homestead it
is solemnly welcomed by the farmer, and attached to
some conspicuous spot on the barn or house. Here it
remains for a year until replaced by its successor.
Another feature of the ceremony, which is no doubt of
the nature of a rain charm, consists in the drenching of
the May and its bearers with water, or in the sprinkling
of them with wine. A variant of this observance is
met with in other parts of Europe, where at some date
after harvest the farmer causes a lofty pole, dressed
with ribbons and hung with handkerchiefs, articles of
clothing, cakes, fruit, etc., to be erected in his field.
The labourers then climb or race for the prizes.<a class="fn" id="fr_337" href="#fn_337">[337]</a></p>
<p>There can be no question as to the antiquity of
these customs. Mannhardt, who has carefully studied
the subject, finds a most remarkable similarity between
the harvest festivals of ancient Greece and those of
modern Europe. The <i>eiresione</i> or harvest-bush of the
Greeks, which is reproduced &ldquo;with almost photographic
exactness&rdquo; in the harvest-May above described,<a class="fn" id="fr_338" href="#fn_338">[338]</a>
was a branch of olive or laurel, bound with red and
white wool, and hung with ribbons, the finest harvest-fruits,
cakes, and jars of honey, oil, and wine. It was
carried in solemn procession with choral songs, at the
Thargelia or feast of first-fruits in the late spring, and
at the Pyanepsia or true harvest-festival in the early
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
autumn, its destination at the former festival being the
temple of Athena Polias, at the latter that of Apollo.
It was planted before the door of the temple, the
contents of the jars attached to it were poured over it,
and the following lines were sung: &ldquo;<i>Eiresione</i> brings
figs and plump loaves, and honey in jars, and oil
wherewith to anoint yourself, and cups of wine unwatered,
that you may drink yourself to sleep.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_339" href="#fn_339">[339]</a> In
addition to this official ceremony each landowner who
grew corn and fruit held his own festival, the <i>eiresione</i>
in that case being suspended or fastened before his
house-door, or placed inside the house beside the
ancestral images. There it remained for a twelve-month,
until on the bringing home of the next year&rsquo;s
branch it was taken down and burnt. It was to
this private <i>eiresione</i> that the familiar passages in
Aristophanes allude. Demos hearing a noise at his
front door, jumps to the conclusion that a street
brawl is imminent: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s making that hullaballoo?&rdquo;
he cries; &ldquo;away from my door. What, will ye tear
down my <i>eiresione</i>?&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_340" href="#fn_340">[340]</a> His dread is that his harvest-branch
will be requisitioned as a weapon of offence, a
possible application of it also alluded to by the poet in
another passage.<a class="fn" id="fr_341" href="#fn_341">[341]</a> Elsewhere it is jestingly said of a
dried-up old woman, that if a spark fell on her, she
would burn up like an old <i>eiresione</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_342" href="#fn_342">[342]</a> a comparison
which throws light on the mode of disposing of the
last year&rsquo;s branch.</p>
<p>The <i>Oschophoria</i>, or carrying in procession of the
<i>oschos</i>, a vine-branch with the ripe grapes upon it,
was another of the Athenian harvest festivals, and
is interesting in the present connection from its being
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
associated, like some modern harvest observances,
with a racing competition.</p>
<p>These festivals, which were probably of prehistoric
origin, were in classical times sanctified for the popular
mind by being linked with and accounted for by some
legendary event which appealed to the patriotic sentiment.
But in spite of this they would appear in
course of time to have undergone something of the
same debasement as our own May observances, and
degenerated into a begging procession from door to
door. At any rate the word <i>eiresione</i>, originally
applied to the festival hymn as well as to the branch,
became in later times the general name for all begging-songs.
Initially, however, the <i>eiresione</i> was, no doubt,
a symbolical representation of the genius of vegetation,
and as such was addressed as a person.<a class="fn" id="fr_343" href="#fn_343">[343]</a></p>
<p>Traced to its remote origin, there can be little
doubt that the ceremony of bringing in the May
arose from a similar process of reasoning. The gods
or spirits of those far-off times had their habitation,
or at least manifested their activity, in the tree. The
gifts of rain and sunshine were in their hands. They
made the crops to grow, the herds to multiply, and
women to give increase. According to Aeneas Sylvius,
the Lithuanians believed that their sacred groves
were the house of the god who gave them rain and
sunshine.<a class="fn" id="fr_344" href="#fn_344">[344]</a> In Circassia the pear-tree is still regarded
as the protector of cattle, and in the autumn is cut
down, carried home, and worshipped as a god.<a class="fn" id="fr_345" href="#fn_345">[345]</a> In
many countries trees are held to have the power of
helping women in childbirth.<a class="fn" id="fr_346" href="#fn_346">[346]</a> It was therefore no
more unnatural for an ignorant peasantry to believe
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
that the same power and influence existed in the cut
branches of trees than it is for a modern uncultured
Catholic to expect help from sacred relics. In
each case the process of thought is the same.
Eventually the ceremony of carrying the branch
round the village, the primitive purpose of which
was to make each house a sharer in the benevolent
offices of the tree-spirit, degenerated into a meaningless
observance, a pretext for indulging in festivities
and levying contributions. But there can be no
doubt that the securing of fertility and abundance,
together with the supply of rain and sunshine necessary
thereto, was originally the root-idea of the worldwide
spring observances.</p>
<p>(2) The custom of setting up the May-pole on
the village green had, no doubt, a similar genesis. It
represented for the community what the May-day
decoration of the house represented for the family.
In parts of Europe the pole is sometimes planted in
front of the Mayor&rsquo;s or Burgomaster&rsquo;s house.<a class="fn" id="fr_347" href="#fn_347">[347]</a> The
intention, evidently, was to bring to the village as a
whole the newly-quickened generative spirit resident
in the woods. The custom of cutting down a tree,
decorating it with garlands and ribbons, re-erecting it,
and f&ecirc;ting it with dance and song, has prevailed in
almost every country in the world. In some instances
it is further dressed as a mortal, or a human image is
attached to it, as in the Attis rites, testifying to the
anthropomorphic conception of the tree-spirit. The
doll placed in the centre of the children&rsquo;s May garlands
would seem to be a survival of this custom. The same
feature of the celebration is illustrated most clearly in
the Greek festival of the little Daedala, which may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
regarded as &ldquo;a classical equivalent of an English May-day
in the olden time.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_348" href="#fn_348">[348]</a> The festival was inaugurated
in an ancient oak-forest. Cooked meat was placed
upon the ground and the movements of the birds
which came to feed upon it were carefully observed.
The tree upon which a bird was first observed to alight
with the meat in its bill was cut down, carved into the
image of a woman, and dressed as a bride. It was
then placed upon a cart and drawn in procession with
singing and dancing. It must be added that Mr.
Farnell regards this festival as a survival from prehistoric
times of the processional ceremony of the
&ldquo;sacred marriage&rdquo; between Zeus and Hera, which
may possibly have been symbolical of the marriage of
earth and heaven in spring.<a class="fn" id="fr_349" href="#fn_349">[349]</a></p>
<p>In the case of our own May-pole, it was originally,
no doubt, the custom to erect a fresh tree every year,
in order that the newly-awakened energy of the forest
might be communicated to the village, and in many
parts this feature of the custom appears to have survived,
as we may gather from the Puritan accounts
above quoted. Elsewhere, as the intention of the
ceremony was lost sight of, a permanent May-pole
was substituted for the annual tree, and was converted
on May-day, by means of garlands and flowers, into
the semblance of a living growth. The May-tree of
the German village, for instance, is a permanent construction,
made up of several tall trunks.<a class="fn" id="fr_350" href="#fn_350">[350]</a> On May-day,
cakes, sausages, eggs, and other desirable things
are hung upon it, the villagers dance around it, and
the young men climb it to secured its gifts. In some
parts the May-pole is surmounted by a cross, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
symbol of a dead faith is consecrated by that of a
living one.</p>
<p>Yet the old faith long left its traces in several
quaint observances. Amongst the Wends of the Elbe
the cattle were driven every year round the village
tree. The bride imported from another village must
dance around it and pay it her footing. The wounded
villager also gave it money and got himself healed by
rubbing himself against it.<a class="fn" id="fr_351" href="#fn_351">[351]</a> Such usages are only intelligible
on the theory that the tree was once seriously
believed to be the local habitation of a spirit, who concentrated
in himself the marvellous fruitfulness and
healing beneficence of nature.</p>
<p>The custom so often met with on the Continent<a class="fn" id="fr_352" href="#fn_352">[352]</a>
of attaching a young sapling or a branch to the roof
of a house newly built, or in process of erection, is
another survival, descended, no doubt, from the
ancient belief in the benign influence of the tree-inhabiting
spirit. In some places it is usual to
decorate the bough with flowers, ribbons, and strings
of eggs, which last are clearly intended to symbolise
the life-giving power assumed to be the spirit&rsquo;s special
attribute.</p>
<p>(3) But the conception which underlay and actuated
the May celebrations is illustrated still more clearly by
their third feature&mdash;the choice of a youth or maiden,
or both, to personify the reawakened and rejoicing
nature. A great deal of evidence on this subject
has been collected by Mannhardt and Frazer, which
can only be briefly summarised here. In the case of
the begging processions with May-trees or May-boughs
from door to door, it was once really believed
that the good genius of growth was present unseen in
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
the bough. But often he was represented in addition
by a man dressed in green leaves and flowers, or by a
girl similarly adorned, who being looked upon as an
actual representative of the spirit of vegetation, was
supposed to produce the same beneficial effects on the
fowls, the fruit-trees, and the crops as the presence of
the deity himself. &ldquo;The names May, Father May,
May Lady, Queen of the May, by which the anthropomorphic
spirit of vegetation is often denoted, show
that the conception of the spirit of vegetation is blent
with a personification of the season at which his
powers are most strikingly manifested.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_353" href="#fn_353">[353]</a></p>
<p>In some cases the human representative of the
tree-spirit goes hand in hand with his vegetable
representative, the tree or branch. The former may
be merely a doll or puppet, as in the Lady of the May
of our own May garlands, or it may be a chosen youth
or girl, who carries a miniature May-tree, or is throned
beside the May-pole, or dances around it, clad in leafy
garments. Sometimes the chief actor in the ceremony
is ducked in a pond or drenched with water, or, as is
still the case in some parts of Ireland, carries a pail of
water and a mop to distribute its contents, with the
idea of ensuring rain by a sort of sympathetic magic.
In other cases the tree disappears from the celebration,
and the whole burden of representing its indwelling
spirit falls upon its human substitute, who in such
event is almost always swathed in leaves or flowers.
The Green George of Carinthia<a class="fn" id="fr_354" href="#fn_354">[354]</a> and our own Jack-in-the-Green
are instances of this custom. The pence
collected no doubt represent what was once a willing
contribution for services presumably useful and worthy
of reward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>The custom of electing a King or Queen of the
May is very general throughout Europe.<a class="fn" id="fr_355" href="#fn_355">[355]</a> The original
purpose was, no doubt, to personify the regal character
of the spirit who ruled the woods, but in other cases
the representative is termed a Bridegroom or Bride,
emphasising another attribute of the deity. In England
the crowning of the May-queen closed the long day&rsquo;s
ceremonies, and the young people who had been up
before sunrise to bring in the May, and had danced all
day upon the village green, ended their pleasant labours
at sundown with this graceful observance.</p>
<p>In some instances <i>two</i> representatives of the spirit
of vegetation were chosen, under the names of King
and Queen, or Prince and Princess, or Lord and Lady.
The King and Queen are mentioned in an English
document of the thirteenth century, and there is
evidence to show that Robin Hood and Maid Marian
were originally representatives of the vegetation spirit,
for the former is spoken of in an old book of 1576 as
King of the May, while Marian or May-Marian, as she
was sometimes called, was certainly a Queen of May,
and as such was represented wearing a golden crown
and carrying in her hand a red pink, the emblem
of summer.<a class="fn" id="fr_356" href="#fn_356">[356]</a></p>
<p>At the time when we first encounter them in
history these celebrations had already lost their
religious significance and passed into graceful observances,
the excuse for innocent mirth. But if we trace
them back into the gloom in which they arose we
come upon evidence which seems to show that they
were not always so innocent. It is quite probable
that in very early times the human representative of
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
the spirit of vegetation was actually sacrificed, in order
that the divine spirit incarnate in him might be
transferred in unabated vigour to his successor,<a class="fn" id="fr_357" href="#fn_357">[357]</a> just
as the old May-pole was destroyed and a new one set
up in its place. Herein was typified the annual death
and resurrection of the spirit of vegetation, a conception
which has given rise to many celebrations, not
always free from bloodshed, in different parts of the
world. The rites by which in Egypt and Western
Asia the death and resurrection of Osiris, Adonis,
Tammuz, Attis, and Dionysus were solemnised find
their parallels not only in the barbarous usages once
current in Mexico, but also in certain spring and
summer celebrations of the peasants of Europe.</p>
<p>The Mexican god of the plant-world was Huitzilopochtli,
and at the feast of Teteionan, mother of the
gods, a woman clothed as the goddess was sacrificed,
her head cut off, and her skin used to dress a youth,
who was then taken to the god&rsquo;s temple, accompanied
by a large crowd of worshippers.<a class="fn" id="fr_358" href="#fn_358">[358]</a> That is to say, the
old embodiment of plant life was killed, and its personality,
typified by the skin, was given to a youthful
successor, who, doubtless, was sacrificed in his turn
when it was considered necessary for the health of
the plant-world.</p>
<p>In some modern European spring observances
the actual putting to death of the spirit of vegetation
survives in symbol. &ldquo;In Lower Bavaria, the
Whitsuntide representative of the tree-spirit&mdash;the
Pfingstl, as he is called&mdash;was clad from top to
toe in leaves and flowers. On his head he wore a
high pointed cap, the ends of which rested on his
shoulders, only two holes being left for his eyes. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
cap was covered with water-flowers and surmounted
with a nosegay of peonies. The sleeves of his coat
were also made of water-plants, and the rest of his
body was enveloped in alder and hazel leaves. On
each side of him marched a boy, holding up one of the
Pfingstl&rsquo;s arms. These two boys carried drawn
swords, and so did most of the others who formed the
procession. They stopped at every house where they
hoped to receive a present, and the people in hiding
soused the leaf-clad boy with water. All rejoiced
when he was well drenched. Finally he waded into
the brook up to his middle, whereupon one of the
boys, standing on the bridge, pretended to cut off his
head.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_359" href="#fn_359">[359]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;At Wurmlingen in Swabia a score of young
fellows dress themselves on Whit-Monday in white
shirts and white trousers with red scarves round their
waists, and swords hanging from the scarves. They
ride on horseback into the wood, led by two trumpeters
blowing their trumpets. In the wood they cut down
leafy oak branches, in which they envelope from head
to foot him who was the last of their number to ride
out of the village. His legs, however, are encased
separately, so that he may be able to mount his horse
again. Further, they give him a long artificial neck,
with an artificial head and a false face on the top of it.
Then a May-tree is cut, generally an aspen or beech
about ten feet high; and being decked with coloured
handkerchiefs and ribbons, it is entrusted to a special
&lsquo;May-bearer.&rsquo; The cavalcade then returns, with
music and song, to the village. Amongst the personages
who figure in the procession are a Moorish
king with a sooty face and crown on his head, a Dr.
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
Iron-Beard, a corporal, and an executioner. They
halt on the village green, and each of the characters
makes a speech in rhyme. The executioner announces
that the leaf-clad man has been condemned to death,
and cuts off his false head. Then the riders race to
the May-tree, which has been set up a little way off.
The first man who succeeds in wrenching it from the
ground as he gallops past keeps it with all its
decorations. The ceremony is observed every second
or third year.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_360" href="#fn_360">[360]</a></p>
<p>In Saxony and Thuringia, at Whitsuntide, the
Wild Man, a person disguised in branches and moss,
was chased through the woods. On being overtaken
he was shot at with blank cartridge and pretended to
fall down dead. A mock doctor then bled him and he
soon came to life again. The rejoicing people placed
him in a waggon, and led him about in procession, to
receive gifts at the houses of the village.<a class="fn" id="fr_361" href="#fn_361">[361]</a></p>
<p>The common feature in all these apparently
senseless observances is the symbolical sacrifice of the
human representative of the spirit of vegetation, and
they drive us to the conclusion that there was a time
when the victim was sacrificed in reality. In the same
way the custom still current in Belgium and French
Flanders at the summer festival of drawing in procession
large wicker figures enclosing living men,
recalls the gigantic images of ozier-work, covered with
leaves, in which the Druids confined the victims
destined for their fiery sacrifices.<a class="fn" id="fr_362" href="#fn_362">[362]</a></p>

<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">CHRISTMAS OBSERVANCES</span></h2>
<p>In modern times, as the once joyful celebrations of
May-day have waned the festivities of Christmas-tide
have undergone increase and development. The
grosser features of the festival have, no doubt, been
eliminated; the mummers and the lord of misrule
have for the most part gone the way of the May-king,
but all the more graceful and orderly observances
of the time have strengthened their hold on the
popular favour. The decoration of the house is as
usual to-day at Christmas as it once was at May-day,
and the Christmas-tree has stepped into the place
which the May-tree once held in the affections of the
young. Yet if we trace these Christmas observances
back to their origin, we find them as distinctively
pagan in their ancestry as the festivities of May-day.</p>
<p>We owe the survival of many pagan customs
largely to the Roman Church, whose settled policy it
was to adapt the old festal rites to the purposes of the
new faith, and to divert its rude converts from the
riotous festivities of their unconverted friends by offering
them the more orderly rejoicings of a Christian
holy day. Gregory the Great, when he sent his
missionaries to Britain, instructed them to Christianise
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
the festivals and temples of the heathen, &ldquo;raising their
stubborn minds upwards not by leaps, but step by
step.&rdquo; And Dr. Tille, in his learned work on the
German Christmas,<a class="fn" id="fr_363" href="#fn_363">[363]</a> has shown what pains were taken
by the priesthood to transfer to their own feast the
rude rejoicings with which the unconverted Germans
celebrated their great festival at the beginning of winter.
The same transference of pre-Christian usages occurred
in Italy, where the Christmas festival, first definitely
fixed at the time of the winter solstice by Bishop
Liberius, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 354,<a class="fn" id="fr_364" href="#fn_364">[364]</a> inherited, as expressly stated by
Polydore Virgil, several of the features of the great
Roman festival of the Saturnalia, held about the same
time. This festival was an occasion for universal
mirth and festivity. Friends visited and feasted each
other, and there was a general interchange of presents,
the objects presented consisting usually of branches,
wax tapers, and clay dolls. The stalls were laden
with gifts, like the Christmas shops of to-day. One
of the days of the festival, the <i>dies juvenalis</i>, was
devoted to children. The solstitial character of the
festival is shown by the fact that another of its days
was dedicated by the Emperor Aurelian to the Persian
sun-god, Mithra; and Varro states that the clay dolls,
which were an important feature of the celebration,
represented the infant sacrifices once made to a
Phoenician Baal who had been introduced to Rome
under the name of Saturn or Cronos.<a class="fn" id="fr_365" href="#fn_365">[365]</a></p>
<p>However this may be, it is clear that some observances
familiar to us at Christmas&mdash;the feasting, the
present giving, and the now obsolete mumming&mdash;have
an origin which is lost in antiquity. Other customs,
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
too, though with a different <i>provenance</i>, have an
equally venerable ancestry. The use of mistletoe, for
instance, is without doubt a direct legacy from the
Druids, who were wont at the time of the solstices
solemnly to place upon their altars the mysterious
branch, into which it was thought that the spirit of the
tree retreated when the rest of the leaves had fallen.
This practice, strangely enough, survived until within
comparatively recent years in a ceremonial practised
at York Minster and some other northern churches,<a class="fn" id="fr_366" href="#fn_366">[366]</a>
though as a rule the introduction of the mistletoe
into Christian edifices was strongly reprobated, on the
score that it was a heathen emblem.</p>
<p>The practice of decorating the house at the New
Year with holly and other evergreens was also a pagan
observance. Dr. Chandler refers to it as a Druidic
custom, the intention being to provide the sylvan
spirits with a shelter to which they might repair, &ldquo;and
remain unnipped with frost and cold winds, until a
milder season had renewed the foliage of their darling
abodes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_367" href="#fn_367">[367]</a> In early times the Church made a stand
against this use of evergreens as being a pagan
custom, but the interdict was not persevered in, and
later on we find the decoration of the churches a recognised
practice, the note for Christmas eve in the old
Calendar being, <i>Templa exornantur</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_368" href="#fn_368">[368]</a></p>
<p>The observance, however, which most concerns us
here is that of the Christmas-tree, the evolution of
which furnishes us with one of the most interesting
chapters in the history of religious development. To
the present generation the Christmas-tree appears such
an essential feature of the festival, as celebrated in this
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
country, that many will be surprised to hear how
recent an importation it is. But as a matter of fact, the
Christmas-tree was practically unknown in England
until it was introduced by the late Prince Consort.<a class="fn" id="fr_369" href="#fn_369">[369]</a>
Even in Germany, the land of its origin, it was not
universally established as an integral part of the
festival until the beginning of the present century,<a class="fn" id="fr_370" href="#fn_370">[370]</a> and
it was only at that date that it came to be known as
the &ldquo;Weihnachtsbaum&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christbaum.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_371" href="#fn_371">[371]</a> Goethe
in 1774 describes it as adorned with wax tapers,
sweetmeats, and apples, but calls it simply the &ldquo;decorated
tree.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_372" href="#fn_372">[372]</a> Schiller in 1789 finds no more distinctive
name for it than the &ldquo;green tree.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_373" href="#fn_373">[373]</a> Since that time,
or rather since 1830, its diffusion throughout the world
has been so marvellously rapid that there is nothing
to compare with it in the whole history of popular
customs.</p>
<p>In Germany the Christmas-tree can be traced back
more or less in its present form to the beginning of
the seventeenth century, when an unnamed writer, in
some extremely fragmentary notes, tells us that it was
the custom at Strasburg to set up fir-trees in the
houses at Christmas, and to deck them with roses of
coloured paper, apples, etc.<a class="fn" id="fr_374" href="#fn_374">[374]</a> The next mention of it
occurs half a century later in the writings of Professor
Dannhauer, a celebrated theologian, also living in
Strasburg.<a class="fn" id="fr_375" href="#fn_375">[375]</a> &ldquo;Amongst the other absurdities,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;with which men are often more busied at
Christmas than with the Word of God, there is also the
Christmas or fir-tree, which they erect in their houses,
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
hang it with dolls and sweetmeats, and then shake it
and cause it to shed its flowers. I know not the
origin of the custom, it is a child&rsquo;s game.... Far
better were it to lead the children to the spiritual
cedar, Christ Jesus.&rdquo; The reprobation of the Strasburg
preacher was echoed by other divines, and to
this cause probably the Christmas-tree owed its slow
diffusion throughout Germany. The theological dislike
of it, however, as it turned out, was ill-advised, for
eventually the Christmas-tree displaced other popular
observances of a far less innocent nature.</p>
<p>So far we have been treading historical ground,
but in tracing the Christmas-tree still farther back we
have only inference to go upon. The subject, however,
has been carefully worked out by Dr. Tille,<a class="fn" id="fr_376" href="#fn_376">[376]</a> and
the pedigree which he traces for the tree is a most
interesting one. His argument must here be condensed
as closely as possible. The Christmas-tree,
with its lights, its artificial flowers, and its apples and
other fruit, is presumably connected with the legend of
Christmas flowering trees, which was very familiar to
the Middle Ages, and of which the English myth of
the Glastonbury thorn is an example. The origin of
the legend in Germany is thus explained by Dr. Tille:&mdash;It
is not unusual when the season is mild to find trees
blossoming in November, especially the cherry and
the crab-tree. For the old German peasant the New
Year began with the great slaughtering feast early in
November, when the cattle were brought in from the
pastures, and all the superfluous ones were butchered
and feasted on; the winter was thus counted to the
New Year, like the eve to a holy day. Hence when
trees blossomed late, a casual connection was inevitably
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
traced between the strange phenomenon and the New
Year feast at which it took place. On the introduction
of Christianity the feasts of St. Martin, St. Andrew,
and St. Nicholas were substituted for the ancient
festivals. The strange blossoming power of nature
was connected with St. Andrew&rsquo;s Day, and fruit-boughs
severed on that day were believed by the people to
possess particular virtue.<a class="fn" id="fr_377" href="#fn_377">[377]</a> The Mediaeval Church,
always eager to enlist popular superstitions in its
own support, set itself to transfer to Christmas the
blossoming tree of the November festival, and the
legends which related how celebrated magicians like
Albertus Magnus, Paracelsus, and Faustus had made
for themselves a summer in the heart of winter were
incorporated by the monks into the lives of certain
saints.<a class="fn" id="fr_378" href="#fn_378">[378]</a> The belief in trees that blossomed and bore
fruit at Christmas was widely distributed and firmly
held amongst the people in the later Middle Ages. In
the German literature of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries many instances of the miraculous fact are
circumstantially recorded.<a class="fn" id="fr_379" href="#fn_379">[379]</a> A writer in 1430 relates
that &ldquo;not far from Nuremburg there stood a wonderful
tree. Every year, in the coldest season, on the night
of Christ&rsquo;s birth this tree put forth blossoms and
apples as thick as a man&rsquo;s thumb. This in the
midst of deep snow and in the teeth of cold winds.&rdquo;
In a MS. letter of the Bishop of Bamberg, dated 1426,
and preserved in the Hofbibliothek at Vienna, the
actual blossoming of two apple-trees at Christmas is
mentioned as an acknowledged fact, and we find a
Protestant preacher giving full credence to the belief
nearly a couple of centuries later.</p>
<p>But the most striking instance of the hold which
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
such legends had taken on the popular mind is to be
found in connection with our own miraculous tree,
the Glastonbury Thorn&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t13">The winter thorn</p>
<p class="t0">Which blossoms at Christmas, mindful of our Lord.</p>
</div>
<p>This tree, which was the object of such veneration in
the later Middle Ages that the merchants of Bristol
are said to have found the export of its blossoms
extremely remunerative, stood upon an eminence near
the town of Glastonbury. The legend ran that Joseph
of Arimathea, who, according to monkish teaching,
was the first Christian missionary to this country, one
Christmas eve planted his staff in the ground. The
staff, which years previously had been cut from a
hawthorn-tree, at once took root and put forth leaves,
and by the next day was in full blossom. The miracle
was repeated on every subsequent Christmas-day.
Even after the Reformation we find King James I.
and his queen and other persons of quality giving
large sums for cuttings from the tree, which were
believed to have the same miraculous virtue as the
parent thorn, and even in the following reign it was
customary to carry a branch of the tree in procession
and present it to the king. In the Civil War the
original tree was destroyed, but some of its off-shoots
survived, one especially at Quainton in Buckinghamshire,
which suddenly sprang into fame again when
the new style was introduced into the Calendar in
1752, and the people, resenting the loss of their eleven
days, appealed from the decision of their rulers to the
higher wisdom of the miraculous tree. According to
the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i> for 1753, about two thousand
people on the night of 24th December 1752 came
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
with lanthorns and candles to view the thorn-tree,
&ldquo;which was remembered (this year only) to be a slip
from the Glastonbury thorn.&rdquo; As the tree remained
bare the people agreed that 25th December, N.S.,
could not be the true Christmas-day, and refused to
celebrate it as such. Their excitement was intensified
when on 5th January the tree was found to be in full
bloom, and to pacify them the authorities were driven
to decree that the old Christmas-day should be celebrated
as well as the new. It may be added that two
thorn-trees still exist near the ruins of Glastonbury
Abbey, which blossom during the winter, and are
identified by Loudoun with a variety of hawthorn, the
<i>Crataegus oxyacantha praecox</i>, which is admittedly a
winter flowerer.<a class="fn" id="fr_380" href="#fn_380">[380]</a></p>
<p>There is, however, as Mannhardt points out,<a class="fn" id="fr_381" href="#fn_381">[381]</a> another
way in which a fruit-bearing tree became popularly
associated with Christmas. The ancient Church
had devoted the day before Christmas-day to the
memory of Adam and Eve, and it was customary at
Christmas in many parts of the Continent to give a
dramatic representation of the story of the Creation
and Fall in connection with the drama of the Nativity.
Hence arose the Paradise-plays which were familiar
to the Middle Ages from the thirteenth century onward.
The well-known legend that the cross of Christ
was fashioned from a tree which had sprung from a
slip of the Tree of Knowledge served as a link between
the events celebrated so closely together, the Fall and
the Birth of the Redeemer, and gave additional significance
to the scenery of the Paradise-play, consisting,
as it usually did, of trees, or sometimes of a single
tree, laden with apples and decked with ribbons. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
some cases the tree was carried on to the stage by one
of the actors. In this way the apple-bearing tree
became the recognised scenic symbol of Christmas, and
naturally connected itself with, if it did not spring out
of, the very early legend of the Church that all nature
blossomed at the birth of Christ, who Himself, according
to the fanciful symbolism of the time, was the very
Tree of Life which had once stood in paradise.</p>
<p>Another popular custom, which dates back to the
time when the belief in the beneficent power of sylvan
deities was general, is also probably entitled to a
place in the pedigree of the Christmas-tree. It was
customary amongst the ancient Germans on one of the
sacred nights of the winter festival, when, according to
the popular belief, nature was permeated with new life,
to cut wands from the hedges.<a class="fn" id="fr_382" href="#fn_382">[382]</a> These were brought
home, put in water or planted in a pot of moist earth,
and solemnly placed, some in the open air, some in
the stable, and some in the house. A month later
each wand would be in full bloom, and it was then the
custom to carry it round and lightly strike with it
those to whom one wished to impart health, strength,
and fruitfulness. Those struck with it rewarded the
striker with presents, in recompense for the benefit
he was assumed to convey. This custom, which is
probably of Indian origin, survived in some parts of
the Continent as a child&rsquo;s game even in the present
century. Under the influence of Christianity the day
for cutting the wands was delayed, so that they might
bloom at Christmas, and in some parts it is still usual
to arrange that there shall be a flowering branch in
the house at that time. In Nordlingen, a century ago,
families used to compete with each other as to which
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
should be able to show the most flourishing branch at
Christmas-tide.<a class="fn" id="fr_383" href="#fn_383">[383]</a> To this day in Austrian Silesia the
peasant women sally forth at midnight on St. Andrew&rsquo;s
eve to pluck a branch from an apricot-tree. It is put
in water and flowers about Christmas time, and is
taken by them to Mass on Christmas-day.<a class="fn" id="fr_384" href="#fn_384">[384]</a></p>
<p>Amongst people to whom the apple-bearing tree of
the Paradise-play was familiar the substitution for the
blooming branch of an evergreen decked with fruits
and ribbons and artificial flowers was quite natural.
It became, as it were, a proxy for the deciduous
branch, still remaining the occasion for present-giving,
though now the tree became the giver instead of the
receiver of gifts.</p>
<p>The custom of hanging lights upon the Christmas-tree
is a comparatively late innovation, the well-known
print of &ldquo;Christmas in Luther&rsquo;s Home,&rdquo; where an
illuminated fir-tree is represented as the centre of the
festivity, being demonstrably an anachronism. The
Christmas-tree, when we first definitely meet with it at
the beginning of the seventeenth century, was certainly
not illuminated. But the idea of a light-bearing tree
was familiar to the Middle Ages. An old Icelandic
legend relates that once upon a time, at M&ouml;dhrufell,
there stood a mountain-ash which had sprung from the
blood of two innocent persons who had been executed
there.<a class="fn" id="fr_385" href="#fn_385">[385]</a> Every Christmas-eve the tree was seen to be
covered with lights, which the strongest gale could not
extinguish. These lights were its wonderful blossoms,
for in folk-lore lights are often made to represent
flowers and <i>vice-vers&acirc;</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_386" href="#fn_386">[386]</a> In the old French legend of
Perceval, the hero is represented as coming upon a
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
tree illuminated with a thousand candles, and Durmals
le Galois, another hero of mediaeval legend, twice saw
a magnificent tree covered with lights from top to
bottom.<a class="fn" id="fr_387" href="#fn_387">[387]</a></p>
<p>It has already been mentioned that wax-tapers
were given as presents at the Roman Saturnalia, and
it may well be that the connection of lighted candles
with Christmas time may date back to the ancient
solstitial celebrations, in which they were regarded as
symbolical of the new birth of the sun. The same
idea&mdash;that of typifying the renewal of life by means of
lighted tapers&mdash;is found in the Netherlands in connection
with the May-tree, which there bears lights
amongst its other decorations. At Venlo on the Maas
the maidens light the tapers as the evening comes
on and then dance around the lighted tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_388" href="#fn_388">[388]</a> At
L&uuml;neberg, at wedding festivities, it is usual to carry a
&ldquo;May&rdquo; adorned with lights before the bridal pair,
and in the Hartz Mountains the so-called &ldquo;St. John&rsquo;s
tree,&rdquo; round which the peasants dance, is a pyramid
adorned with wreaths, flowers, and lights.</p>
<p>In all these customs, which are no doubt survivals
of the belief in a tree-inhabiting deity, we see the
collateral relations, if not the direct progenitors of our
Christmas-tree. In short, modern as it is in its
present form, the Christmas-tree epitomises many
most ancient ideas; is the point to which many
streams converge whose source is hidden in a far
distant antiquity. It is the meeting-point of the old
pagan belief in the virtues vested in the tree and of
the quaint fancies of the Middle Ages, which loved
to see spiritual truths embodied in material forms.
Christ, the Tree of Life, blossoming on Christmas-eve
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
in Mary&rsquo;s bosom; the fatal tree of paradise whence
sprang the cross, the instrument of man&rsquo;s salvation,&mdash;that
&ldquo;fruit-bearing heavenly-nourished tree planted in
the midst of redeemed man,&rdquo; so often represented in
mediaeval art; the miracle of nature, so stirred by the
wonder of the event as to break forth into blossom in
the midst of winter&mdash;all these ideas, so characteristic
of mediaeval thought, became grafted together with
observances derived from solstitial worship, upon
the stock of the sacred tree, laden with offerings
and decked with fillets. Indeed the Christmas-tree
may be said to recapitulate the whole story of tree-worship,&mdash;the
May-tree, the harvest-tree, the Greek
<i>eiresione</i>, the tree as the symbol and embodiment of
deity, and last but not least, the universe-tree, bearing
the lights of heaven for its fruit and covering the world
with its branches.</p>
